Ocean Risk Resilience Alliance (ORRAA),  Insurance Development Forum (IDF) &  Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment (CCRI);2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/surfs-up-risks-down-how-a-bold-insurance-plan-could-preserve-surfing-hotspots-amid-climate-threats/;August 21, 2024;Surf’s up, risks down: How a bold insurance plan could preserve surfing hotspots amid climate threat;Climate change, however, threatens these impressive opportunities, with sea level rise and more extreme weather events, including through storm surge and coastal flooding which is projected to become more frequent in some regions. This in turn has led to the denigration of ocean floor features such as coral reefs and kelp forests, bays and headlands, and watersheds driving sedimentation rates which help create suitable waves for surfing. A sea swell, colliding with a coral reef or sand bank can generate big, barrelling waves good for surfing. This, together with tourism and the communities that rely on it in these coastal areas, embodies the surf ecosystem. If the physical features that create surf waves are damaged or significantly altered by storm surge and other extreme weather events, the whole surf ecosystem is harmed. In El Salvador, where pristine beaches and perfect waves draw tourists from around the world, the local communities are witnessing this firsthand. As the global climate crisis intensifies, so does the risk to these critical coastal areas, making the preservation of their natural beauty and economic value a pressing challenge. Recognising this, Save The Waves, an organization deeply committed to safeguarding surf ecosystems, has launched an innovative project that could revolutionise how we think about insurance and environmental protection. By introducing a bespoke parametric insurance model, supported by ORRAA the international multi-stakeholder collaboration through funds from the Government of Canada, it is helping protect these vibrant ecosystems but also ensuring that the local communities of El Salvador have the tools to thrive amid increasing environmental threats. The goal is to protect 1,000 surf ecosystems by 2030 and help give coastal communities the tools they need to value, protect, and manage their own natural resources. It currently monitors over 5,000 surf spots around the world – 24 per cent of which are in key biodiversity areas. The parametric insurance model triggers an insurance payout not after, but before disaster strikes – when specific climate conditions are met, e.g. high winds or excessive precipitation. This proactive approach allows communities to secure resources swiftly, minimizing damage and ensuring the continuity of their livelihoods. This initiative is vital as it introduces a financial safety net that is rare in conventional environmental conservation strategies. By ensuring quick payouts through parametric insurance, Save The Waves helps sustain not only the natural surf ecosystems but also the social and economic structures that depend on them. The insurance model has the potential to be replicated in other key surfing regions through Save The Waves’ existing and growing World Surfing Reserves network. The recently announced World Surfing Reserve in Oriente Salvaje, El Salvador will serve as a case study to scale this approach, an effort that is being led in coalition with local partners ADETCO, Paso Pacifico, and Sociedad Salvaje Salvadoreña. Elsewhere, Save The Waves is committed to creating additional surf reserves and supporting ecosystem restoration projects that enhance coastal resilience. These efforts are complemented by educational programs aimed at increasing local awareness about the importance of maintaining and protecting natural resources. The community workshops also teach locals how to leverage these natural assets economically through sustainable tourism, thus creating a cyclical benefit that reinforces the importance of conservation.With the support of international partners and continued financial support, the project not only aims to protect coastal areas but also to enhance them, ensuring they remain vibrant and viable for future generations.;America;El Salvador;;;;Ocean and Coastal Systems;São Paulo's climate resilience strategy focuses on 10 key areas, including nature-based solutions, flood protection, sustainable transport, and public health initiatives.

One Planet Business for Biodiversity;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/mccains-project-360degrees/;July 18, 2024;McCain’s Project 360°: Supporting potato growers’ shift to regenerative agriculture;McCain, a global leader in frozen potato products, has initiated an ambitious project to roll out regenerative agricultural practices across its potato acreage in France. The project aims to promote the transition towards regenerative agriculture practices by creating a network of farms in transition, leveraging pilot farms’ practices, and using soil health specialists to revamp the agricultural processes and protocols used by farmers growing crops for McCain. The initiative responds to the urgent challenges of climate variability and rising input costs that potato growers face today. McCain is a member of the One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) coalition, a Race to Resilience partner, which catalyzes action to protect and restore cultivated and natural biodiversity within agricultural value chains in food, beverages, textiles and cosmetics through regenerative agriculture. Climate change is already severely impacting potato farming. Extreme weather events have already damaged crops and reduced yields. Climate change alters the growing season, affecting the timing of planting and harvesting, increasing the spread of pests and diseases. Unpredictable weather patterns also lead to soil erosion and degradation, making it harder to maintain productive farming systems. Regenerative agriculture is a key solution to create a resilient agricultural system with a positive business model for farmers. It’s a holistic and outcome-based approach that focuses on improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, improving water retention in soil, reducing pesticide risk, improving nutrient-use efficiency and improving farming livelihoods. Key benefits from McCain’s project include: Ensure grower resilience, through the reduction of inputs, energy consumption and yield preservation. Keep carbon in the soil, through cover crops, organic matter addition, and reduced tillage. Farm biodiversity, with increased crop rotation and hedges/flower strips at field boundaries. Reduce agro-chemical inputs with lower toxicity agro-chemicals, predictive modelling technology via satellite, precision nitrogen application, optimized spraying against blight, and increased soil water holding capacity. Reduced tillage: autumn ridging for potatoes, low or no tillage. By adopting these practices, McCain aims to create a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system that can better withstand environmental pressures while also providing long-term benefits to farmers and the ecosystem. McCain’s targets are ambitious. By 2030, the company aims to have all its potato farmers at least at the onboarding level of regenerative practices, which includes training, meeting beginner-level indicators, and completing soil health assessments. Additionally, McCain plans to operate three Farms of the Future by 2025 to serve as innovation hubs for developing and sharing regenerative agriculture practices. To support farmers in this transition, McCain has created a de-risking package for growers in transition including: A six-year regenerative agriculture contract, with a premium of 5€/t. Technical support, at the farm level, to support the transition. A regenerative agriculture-specific loan negotiated with Crédit Agricole, at 0% for the growers and specific payment terms, on a list of investments for the transition McCain’s commitment to regenerative agriculture represents a transformative approach that can benefit both farmers and the planet. For farmers, this shift means adopting practices that enhance soil health, boost yields, and increase resilience to climate change, leading to more stable and profitable farming operations. For the environment, it results in improved biodiversity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and decreased chemical pollution, contributing to a healthier planet. – – The UN Climate Change High-Level Champions (HLCs) have collaborated with Non-State Actors – from farmers and fishers to businesses, cities, civil society, consumers, and all those engaged in food systems – to develop a Non-State Actors Call to Action for Transforming Food Systems for People, Nature, and Climate. The Call to Action, launched ahead of COP28, mobilizes collective efforts around a shared vision of food systems that deliver significant, measurable progress for people, nature, and climate by 2030. Through this shared agenda, the aim is to scale action, raise ambition, and unlock the potential of food systems as one of the main solutions for people, nature, and climate.;Europe;France;Various farming regions in France;480000;200000;Food and Agriculture Systems;McCain’s Project 360° supports the shift of potato farmers in France towards regenerative agriculture.

Resilience First;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-plan-to-protect-london-from-the-growing-flood-threat/;June 26, 2024;A plan to protect London from the growing flood threat;On a grey afternoon in London, the skies open up and rain begins to pour. This is not an uncommon sight, but in recent years, these downpours have become more intense, leading to flash floods that disrupt daily life. Streets quickly transform into rivers, homes are inundated, and the city’s ageing infrastructure struggles to cope. London, like many major cities around the world, is on the frontlines of climate change. Rising sea levels and more frequent, severe storms are no longer just future threats – they are happening now. In response to these growing threats, TEAM2100, part of the Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) plan has been launched to improve London’s flood defenses. Led by Jacobs, the Environment Agency, Balfour Beatty and Race to Resilience partner, Resilience First, the initiative seeks to protect the city and its inhabitants through planning, cutting-edge technology, and strategic asset management. The project covers a 330km stretch of the River Thames, home to 1.4 million people, and over £321 billion worth of property across London, Essex, and Kent. The initiative involves the maintenance and enhancement of more than 4,000 assets, including walls, embankments, flood gates, outfalls, and pumps. Many of these structures are over 30 years old, and some exceed a century. The situation London faces significant flood risks due to rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storms driven by climate change. The Thames Barrier, crucial for the city’s protection, was originally designed for a 1-in-1,000-year storm surge. However, with the current pace of climate change-induced sea-level rise, this protection level is diminishing, leaving the city more vulnerable. The city’s infrastructure, including transport hubs, financial institutions, and cultural landmarks, is particularly susceptible to flooding. The London Underground, much of which runs below the water table, could face severe disruptions in the event of major flooding, leading to substantial economic losses. London’s growing population and urban development increase the flood risk. New constructions often occur in flood-prone areas, and the added impermeable surfaces exacerbate surface water flooding. Moreover, many existing flood defenses are ageing and need significant maintenance and upgrades to remain effective. Contaminated floodwaters can also disrupt ecosystems and water supplies, while vulnerable communities, particularly low-income residents, may struggle with displacement and prolonged recovery efforts. Solution TEAM2100’s primary aim is to build London’s flood defenses against these escalating threats. The project involves regular inspections, upgrades and refurbishments, and asset management. Detailed assessments of all flood defense assets will be conducted to evaluate their condition and identify necessary improvements. Strengthening existing defenses ensures they can withstand future sea level rises and more frequent storm surges. The project will be as adaptable as possible, continuously responding to new climate data and changing environmental conditions. Part this will involve investing in the right places at the right times to reduce overall costs and deliver greater value for public money. At the core of the project is enhancing the resilience of the most vulnerable populations. The project aims to directly increase the resilience of 229,000 people living in high-risk areas along the Thames. This estimate is based on the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, a government measure that considers factors such as income, employment, health, education, and access to services. Broader goals include enhancing public areas, promoting sustainable transport, and supporting resilient economic growth. This will hopefully entail creating better public spaces and reducing carbon emissions which will ultimately improve the overall quality of life for its residents. As climate change accelerates, the need to protect London from flooding will only grow more urgent. Ensuring the city’s future resilience will require ongoing innovation, strategic investments, radical collaboration and a respect and consideration for generations to come.;Europe;United Kingdom;London;515000;-7000;Infrastructure Systems;The TEAM2100 project in London is designed to protect the city from the growing threat of flooding due to rising sea levels and more intense storms. Covering 330 km of the River Thames, the project upgrades over 4,000 flood defense assets to safeguard 229,000 people and £321 billion worth of property. By enhancing the resilience of London's infrastructure, the initiative plays a crucial role in adapting to climate change and securing the city against future flood risks.;Flood protection, infrastructure resilience, sea level rise, climate adaptation, urban planning
Initiative 20×20;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/revitalizing-landscapes-damaged-by-intensive-agriculture-in-brazils-parana-state/;May 28, 2024;Revitalizing landscapes damaged by intensive agriculture in Brazil’s Paraná State;In the agricultural state of Paraná, Brazil, a project is underway to combat the environmental degradation wrought by decades of intensive agriculture. Brazil faces a significant challenge with approximately 140 million hectares of land already degraded, a situation exacerbated by a rapid increase in grain cultivation which surged by 80% between 1996 and 2006. This intensive land use has led to lower yields, loss of biodiversity, degraded soils, unstable water supplies, and hardships for local communities reliant on these lands for their livelihoods.In response to these challenges, the SLB Group, under the partnership with MIROVA and supported by Race to Resilience partner, Initiative 20×20, created a program designed to restore 1,400 hectares of land previously degraded by intensive agricultural practices.The initiative is part of a broader commitment to restore and preserve a total area that includes 2,500 hectares of FSC-certified plantations and 1,500 hectares of conserved forest. The project not only revitalizes the land but also sustains around 300 local jobs, enhancing living conditions and boosting local economies.In alignment with the Principles for Ecosystem Restoration to Guide the United Nations Decade, this project applies the following aspects to distinguish itself from traditional eucalyptus monocultures:Small and well-spread plantations that reduce pressure on ecosystems compared to large-scale models, guaranteeing higher biodiversity levels. SLB plants in a mosaic system, on smaller land plots, to preserve natural resources.Planting in areas that have been degraded by intensive farming, deforestation, and overgrazing. The project focuses on land that was affected by intensive agriculture, notably conventional palm oil and soy plantations, to enable land restoration and soil improvement.Applying a lower planting density compared to traditional timber plantations to preserve natural resources. SLB uses a lower density than its traditional peers in the region, allowing restoration of hydric capital and natural resources as well as growth of high quality and value-added wood.A strong commitment to biodiversity and habitat restoration. SLB’s plantations have an average of 40% of managed land dedicated to the conservation and regeneration of native habitats. This supports biodiversity, with various species returning to SLB plantation areas – including the puma, recently sighted after a 15-year absence. To date, more than 1,500 hectares are being preserved, and SLB has identified over 27 species of interest.A carbon strategy that quantifies the atmospheric CO2 captured. In SLB’s planted forests and conservation areas, it is estimated that the project will enable sequestration of up to 200,000 tCO2SLB has also developed a patented input, “Terra Fertilis”, an organic, biochar-based fertilizer that significantly reduces the use of agrochemicals while supporting tree growth, soil health and soil organic carbon levels. SLB’s research and development in this supports EMBRAPA’s efforts to promote the use of biochar on a wider scale in the forestry sector in Brazil and worldwide.To support this restoration and promote sustainable forestry, Mirova is providing a $12.6M investment to SLB through its Land Degradation Neutrality Fund. In the coming years, the group aims to expand this model and restore up to 20,000 hectares of degraded land, not only making a significant contribution to sustainability in Brazil’s forestry sector, but also engaging in even more active conservation and restoration.—About Initiative 20×20Initiative 20×20 is a country-led effort seeking to change the dynamics of land degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean by beginning to protect and restore 50 million hectares of forests, farms, pasture, and other landscapes by 2030. The initiative—launched formally at COP 20 in Lima in 2014—supports the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests, global commitments to bring 350 million hectares of the world’s deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2030.So far, 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries and three regional programs have committed to improve more than 52 million hectares of land (or about 124 million acres, an area roughly the size of Paraguay and Nicaragua combined) through Initiative 20×20.The initiative is supported by more than 85 technical organizations and institutions and a coalition of impact investors and funds deploying US$3.09 billion in private investment.About the Race to ResilienceThe Race to Resilience campaign – the sibling campaign to Race to Zero – is the race to catalyze a step-change in global ambition, to accelerate the investment and implementation of adaptation solutions, and to put people and nature first in pursuit of a resilient world where we do not just survive climate shocks and stresses, but thrive in spite of them.The Campaign was launched by the UN Climate Change High-level Champions in January 2021 at the Climate Adaptation Summit, alongside the State-driven Adaptation Action Coalition.The ultimate goal of the Race to Resilience is to increase the resilience of four billion people living in vulnerable communities, in collaboration with partner organisations from around the world, while developing tools to support them in their work. It prioritizes the climate risks faced by urban, rural and coastal vulnerable communities and elevates the potential and actions that NSAs( e.g. businesses, cities, regions, finance sector, CSOs, local communities) are already pursuing towards system transformations enhancing resilience.

Initiative 20×20;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/new-agroforestry-systems-set-to-transform-sierra-nevadas-national-park/;May 23, 2024;Coffee, cocoa, and conservation – New agroforestry systems set to transform Sierra Nevada’s national park;Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Park in Colombia is a natural wonder, featuring the world’s highest coastal mountain range. This UNESCO-designated Biosphere Reserve stretches skyward, with peaks reaching an altitude of 5,775 meters (18,947 feet) above sea level, just 42 kilometers (26 miles) from the Caribbean coast. The drastic elevation gradient from sea level to snow-capped peaks within such a short horizontal distance creates a spectacular array of ecosystems, from tropical beaches and coral reefs to cloud forests and permanently snow-covered mountains. This park is not only a sanctuary for countless species of flora and fauna, many of which are endemic and endangered, but also a vital water source for the surrounding regions, making it a critical area for both ecological and human sustenance.Located in the buffer zone of this protected area, a project is underway to transform agriculture through coffee and cocoa agroforestry systems, aiming to revitalize degraded lands while promoting economic and climate resilience. It’s the second project funded by a partner of Race to Resilience partner, 20×20, Urapi Sustainable Land Use.The core objective of the RioSierra Project is to convert old, underperforming coffee farms and establish new cocoa agroforestry systems on previously degraded lands. This approach not only rejuvenates the soil and local ecosystems but also provides substantial support to smallholder farmers by supplying essential resources such as seedlings. This aids them in renovating existing plots or initiating new ones, thereby enhancing their livelihoods and ensuring sustainable land use.In addition to improving agricultural productivity, the project prioritizes ecosystem recovery and biodiversity enhancement, contributing to significant carbon sequestration efforts. The initiative is designed to bolster farmer resilience by diversifying their income through the integration of honey and timber production into their agricultural practices, coupled with generating carbon credits to align financial incentives with global climate action objectives.The project was co-designed with Red Ecolsierra, a collective of 22 coffee farmer associations that was established in 2001 and currently boasts 394 members. It’s managed by ECOTIERRA and backed by a $8.6 million investment from the LDN Fund over 13 years. Investments include the development of collection centres, a biofertilizer plant, and a state-of-the-art coffee processing mill. These facilities not only add value to the agricultural products but also improve market access for farmers, enhancing their economic stability.The project provides extensive technical assistance, focusing on agricultural practices: By enhancing the understanding of the ecological conditions and market demands for products like timber and honey, the project ensures the integration of suitable varieties that bolster the business case for these commodities.Market analysis for cocoa: This involves analyzing niche market dynamics for cocoa to tailor production to specific consumer demands, thus maximizing profitability.Conservation initiatives: Efforts are made to identify potential conservation partners and assess additional land for conservation purposes, aiming to conserve an ambitious target of 70,000 hectares in the park’s buffer zone.Data collection and monitoring: Establishing comprehensive data collection systems for the 400 already engaged producers helps in effective project management and supports initiatives for carbon finance and biodiversity monitoring.The RioSierra Project is set to have a transformative impact on the region, with plans to restore 4,500 hectares of land through sustainable agroforestry practices and engage 1,500 farmers, including a proactive effort to involve women, making up 20% of participants. The project also targets the sequestration of approximately 1,300,000 CO2eq.About Initiative 20×20Initiative 20×20 is a country-led effort seeking to change the dynamics of land degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean by beginning to protect and restore 50 million hectares of forests, farms, pasture, and other landscapes by 2030.

Initiative 20×20;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-in-action-replacing-degraded-land-in-suriname-with-sustainable-coconut-farms/;May 14, 2024;Replacing degraded land in Suriname with sustainable coconut farms;Nestled on the northeastern coast of South America, Suriname is abundant with biodiversity and natural capital, with forests that cover over 90% of its territory.This verdant landscape makes it a pivotal player in global carbon sequestration efforts, absorbing significant amounts of CO2 and mitigating the broader impacts of climate change.In September 2023, Pomeroon Trading, a sustainable coconut company in the Caribbean that restores degraded land with sustainable coconut farms, launched an agroforestry project in the Coronie District. The project aims to combine sustainable agriculture with effective carbon offset practices, establishing a coconut seedling nursery and planting hardwood trees across a sprawling 1,200-hectare farm leased from the Surinamese government.Agroforestry, the practice of integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, offers an alternative to conventional farming, which often strips the soil of nutrients and increases susceptibility to pests. By incorporating diverse tree species, Pomeroon Trading’s approach enhances biodiversity, improves soil health, and conserves water. This strategy not only echoes the natural dynamics of ecosystems but also strengthens them, creating resilient environments that also offer sustainable economic opportunities for local communities.Alongside its agroforestry initiatives, Pomeroon Trading is engaged in carbon offsetting – a process that is meant to balance out carbon dioxide emissions through projects such as renewable energy, reforestation, and methane capture from waste.The project’s focus extends to restoring mangroves in the Coronie and Commewijne districts, areas critical for their carbon sequestration capabilities and their role as natural defenses against coastal erosion. With rising sea levels and increased storm surges posing a growing threat, these restoration efforts are vital for protecting the coastline and reducing the adverse effects of climate change on vulnerable communities.At the heart of Pomeroon Trading’s strategy is a commitment to community involvement. Local communities, with their profound knowledge of the land and traditional practices, are essential to the success of environmental initiatives. By involving them in both planning and implementation, the project is ensuring that its projects are not only environmentally sound but also culturally sensitive and socially inclusive.This community-first approach provides substantial benefits, from enhancing food security through diversified agriculture to empowering local residents with sustainable livelihoods. Moreover, it cultivates a sense of ownership and commitment among the locals, crucial for the longevity and success of the projects.The collaboration with KlimatX and specialists like Silvestrum Climate Associates brings a wealth of knowledge and resources, ensuring that the projects adhere to international standards such as those set by Verra and Initiative Race to Resilience initiative, 20×20. This not only reinforces the scientific and technical rigour of the initiatives but also aligns them with global best practices in sustainability and carbon credit generation.As the impacts of climate change intensify worldwide, the importance of building climate resilience cannot be overstated. Through its innovative agroforestry and mangrove restoration projects, Pomeroon Trading is playing a key role in protecting Suriname’s agricultural and ecological landscapes against extreme weather and other climate-related challenges, safeguarding the future of the nation’s communities and their natural heritage. These efforts not only contribute to Suriname’s environmental and economic stability but also set a precedent for sustainable land management practices globally.;South America;Suriname;Coronie District, Commewijne District;563000;-557500;Food and Agriculture Systems;The project in Suriname focuses on converting degraded lands into sustainable coconut farms, aiming to restore ecosystems, improve soil health, and enhance biodiversity.

Initiative 20×20;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-in-action-restoring-soil-with-agroforestry-systems-in-northern-belize/;May 8, 2024;Restoring soil with agroforestry systems in Northern Belize;The majority of the world’s farms use synthetic and dangerous products, which threaten the health of humans and the environment. In northern Belize, agrochemicals are used extensively in sugarcane production, the industry that dominates the local economy and landscape. In the region, sugarcane production, conventional farming, and cattle production have had significant negative repercussions for the environment, including deforestation, soil degradation, and water contamination. Since 2017, Sustainable Harvest International (SHI)-Belize has partnered with 90 rural families from the communities of Chunox, San Luis, and Patchakan to lead restoration in the region and address this issue. By training farmers in regenerative agricultural techniques, SHI-Belize is working to restore the environment while improving families’ health and livelihoods. With the technical support of SHI-Belize, partner families lead the project by implementing agroforestry systems on their land. These systems intercrop hardwood trees and subsistence crops without the use of agrochemicals and toxic products. Among the many benefits of agroforestry systems are their ability to improve microbial activity in soils and enhance fertility, which in turn increases crop yields and food production. Throughout the project, SHI field trainers support farmers with technical assistance on a wide range of topics including soil restoration, pest and disease management, nutrition, income generation, and environmental responsibility. Through agroforestry, partnering farmers produce healthier crops, free of agrochemicals, that improve their family’s diet and increase their income. They are reforesting their land by growing hardwood trees that will directly benefit future generations. Meanwhile, they are growing community awareness of the benefits of agroforestry systems by sharing their knowledge and skills with neighbors and other farmers. The SHI-Belize restoration project consists of a total of 68 agroforestry systems across three communities. By diversifying crops, farmers are able to maximize productivity and efficiency on their land. Across all 68 agroforestry systems, SHI-Belize has planted four species of hardwood trees (Mahogany, Cedar, Ziricote, and Neem), six species of perennial fruits (soursop, coconut, pineapple, plantain, banana, and apple banana), three species of root tubers (jicama, cassava, and cocoyam), and one species of spice (Annatto). In total, farmers working with SHI-Belize have planted 1,590 hardwood trees, 12,210 perennial fruits, 5,580 root tubers, and 175 spice plants. SHI-Belize estimates that in their very first year of production, hardwood trees will generate $795,000 in additional income for farmers, perennial fruits will generate $255,130, root tubers will generate $25,110, and spices will generate $10,500, creating nearly $1.1 million dollars of additional income for the 90 families. Many of these plants will continue to produce long after their first year of production. When taking into account the entire productive life cycle of each crop, the total value of the restoration project increases significantly. For example, perennial fruits will produce an estimated $2,038,720 over a ten-year period while spices will produce $105,000 over the same period. The SHI-Belize agroforestry project demonstrates that farmers can radically improve their livelihoods while restoring their local environment. These farmers are reforesting the land and helping mitigate climate change, all while earning income to improve their well-being. In fact, SHI-Belize estimates that the project will put a grand total of $2,963,830 in partnering farmers’ pockets. SHI-Belize intends to replicate this restoration project, expanding into other communities to restore land, increase carbon sequestration and crop production, while creating economic opportunities for families that support and promote healthy, thriving, and biodiverse ecosystems. Initiative 20×20 is an effort led by 17 countries seeking to change the dynamics of land degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean by beginning to protect and restore 50 million hectares of forests farms, pasture and other landscapes by 2030.

Scale for Resilience;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-in-action-strengthening-climate-resilience-in-senegal-through-digital-agricultural-finance/;May 1, 2024;Strengthening climate resilience in Senegal through digital agricultural finance;In Senegal, the impact of climate change is acutely felt across its vast agricultural landscapes, where smallholder farmers – many of whom are women –face increasing vulnerability due to erratic weather patterns. This challenge necessitates not only robust adaptation strategies but also accessible financial solutions that cater specifically to the needs of these communities. CAURIE Microfinance, in collaboration with Race to Resilience partner, YAPU Solutions and supported financially by GAWA Capital through the Huruma Fund, is pioneering a transformative approach to agricultural finance to enhance climate resilience among these critical population groups.—The journey of adaptation to climate change is complex and varied across different regions and crops. In Senegal, where agriculture employs over 70% of the rural population and contributes significantly to the national economy, the need for targeted and efficient adaptation measures is critical. This involves a nuanced understanding of local conditions, climate threats, and the specific needs of the agricultural sectors most affected.In Senegal, the adverse effects of climate change are disproportionately borne by women and other vulnerable populations, particularly in rural areas where agriculture serves as the primary livelihood. Erratic rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and frequent droughts have exacerbated challenges in water scarcity and food security, directly affecting the daily lives and economic stability of these groups.Women, who constitute a significant portion of the agricultural workforce, face heightened risks as they are often responsible for gathering water, securing food, and sustaining family farms. The changing climate not only threatens their crops but also their roles within their communities and families, pushing them into a cycle of increased labor with diminishing returns.Furthermore, these vulnerable communities often lack the resources to implement effective adaptation strategies independently. Limited access to land, financial services, and technology prevents them from employing advanced agricultural techniques that could mitigate the impacts of climate variability. This situation underscores the critical need for tailored financial solutions and educational programs that empower these groups to manage climate risks more effectively.Established in 1996, CAURIE Microfinance has grown into a key institution within Senegal’s microfinance sector, with a significant focus on empowering women. It currently manages a loan portfolio of $27 million USD, serving 77,000 borrowers, of which 78% are women. Recognizing the urgent need for resilience in agriculture, CAURIE has been proactive in integrating digital tools to enhance its lending processes:Risk Management and Digital Integration: Implementing a gender-sensitive Climate Risk Management policy, CAURIE uses the YAPU platform to incorporate real-time climate risk assessments into their loan processes. This digital integration helps align loan approvals with the latest climate data, ensuring that financial resources are allocated to the most effective adaptation measures.Capacity Building for Sustainable Practices: Extensive training programs are set up for both staff and borrowers to heighten awareness and implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices. This educational outreach is critical in fostering a community well-versed in adaptation strategies.Data-Driven Agricultural Lending: By developing a referential data system, CAURIE enables loan officers to make informed decisions based on detailed, crop-specific economic data and sustainability factors. This approach is crucial in supporting agricultural practices that are both profitable and environmentally sustainable.To date, CAURIE has disbursed 620 loans focusing on sustainable solutions like drip irrigation systems, organic fertilizers, and solar energy products, which are essential for promoting sustainable agriculture in the face of climate change. These efforts not only help mitigate the impact of environmental challenges but also support the economic stability of farming households.Looking forward, CAURIE is committed to expanding its portfolio of adaptation and resilience loans. The future strategy includes enhancing automated reporting to better align with global sustainability goals and agendas, furthering the reach and impact of their financial products.;Africa;Senegal;Multiple rural regions;144974;-144524;Cross Cutting: Finance;In Senegal, digital finance tools are being used to strengthen climate resilience, particularly among smallholder farmers and women in rural areas.

Scale for Resilience;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/empowering-jamaicas-climate-resilience-through-innovative-green-finance/;March 13, 2024;Empowering Jamaica’s climate resilience through innovative green finance;Jamaica, an island nation celebrated for its breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture, finds itself at the forefront of the global climate crisis. Despite its relatively minimal contribution to global emissions, Jamaica faces some of the most immediate and severe dangers posed by climate change, from hurricanes to sea-level rise, and land erosion. Amid these challenges, Jamaica is also a land of untapped potential, boasting abundant renewable energy sources, including wind, biomass, and solar energy. Historically underutilized, these resources present a golden opportunity to meet a significant portion of the island’s future energy requirements sustainably. Recognizing the urgency of these challenges, the COK Sodality Co-operative Credit Union, a leading financial institution in the Caribbean, launched an initiative in 2018 to empower its 275,000 members and the broader Jamaican population to combat the adverse effects of climate change.The initiative focuses on providing financial solutions for renewable energy and energy efficiency, specifically targeting micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and low-income households. By offering loans for solar panel installations and energy-efficient appliances, the initiative aims to enhance the community’s resilience to climate-related disruptions and promote sustainable living practices.This project was made possible through a collaboration with the IDB Lab and Race to Resilience Partner Initiative, YAPU Solutions, which brought technical assistance and a digital climate risk management system to the table. This system enabled COK Sodality to assess the climate risk of each loan application, ensuring that financial support was directed towards projects that would have the most significant impact on climate adaptation and resilience.One of the key achievements of this initiative was the development of strong partnerships with over ten solar providers, which facilitated the widespread adoption of renewable energy solutions within the community. Additionally, the project prioritized inclusivity by offering favourable loan conditions, such as reduced interest rates for women, who make up 53% of the borrowers, and using solar panel systems as collateral, making it easier for a broader segment of the population to participate.To date, the initiative has seen a significant increase in green loans as a percentage of COK Sodality’s portfolio.

DARAJA;2024;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-partner-initiatve-wins-world-habitat-award-for-early-warning-tool/;March 7, 2024;Race to Resilience partner initiatve wins World Habitat Award for early warning tool;"People living in informal urban settlements are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, like storms, floods, and heatwaves. Yet these same communities are often unable to access weather information that could help save their lives or prevent devastating damage to their homes and livelihoods. DARAJA (Developing Risk Awareness through Joint Action) is a weather forecasting and early warning system specifically for residents of informal settlements. It operates in Kenya and Tanzania, where it provides regular, reliable weather information in accessible, easy-to-understand formats. The service also encourages people to carry out repairs to their homes and public spaces to minimize weather-related damage. Informal settlement communities were heavily involved in the design of the service, which is run by global social enterprise and Race to Resilience Transformation Partner, Resurgence, in partnership with a wide network of local organizations. DARAJA has received $2 million in funding through Resurgence and has an annual budget of $300,000. Since September 2018, DARAJA has provided almost 1 million people in Kenya and Tanzania with better weather information, and it is believed that accessing the service has led to a 300% increase in household repairs made in response to weather forecasts in Nairobi, and a 122% increase in Dar es Salaam. The service is now developing in Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia. It is also being adapted for use in small island states. DARAJA hopes 25% of the 1 billion people living in informal settlements worldwide will be able to access its services by 2030. In action, Agnella Malilima (31) is a resident living at the informal settlement of Kigogo Mbuyuni in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, staying at Kigogo with her parents and siblings in a 3-bedroom house. Before the introduction of the DARAJA project at Kigogo settlement Agnella admitted that the decision to not follow the weather information adversely affected her in various ways; some days she did not go to work because she had to help her parents at home after being hit by floods or extreme high temperatures. This caused the delay in receiving her monthly salary of 200,000 TZS ($80) a couple of months in 2017 and 2018. When floods occurred, she had to use a lot of time to recover from the impacts of the flood like removing mud at home, washing clothes with stains, and supervising the masons to do the repair of the house. In between October – December, she bought the bricks costing her approximately 150,000 TZS ($60) to do the repairing of their house. Her father is also a very old man and blind. When they got flooded, she had to spend a lot of time making more arrangements about her father on where she could take him so he could stay. When the CCI community team in Tanzania and Resurgence (the UK partner) started implementing the DARAJA project at Kigogo around December 2018, she started to understand about DARAJA and after joining the saving group, she learned about federation activities and how they work with organizations such as CCI to address community problems relating to climate change, entrepreneurship, water, and sanitation. “After being told about the importance of paying attention to access, understand and using weather information to reduce climate change impacts, I directly thought about the suffering that myself, my father, and family were experiencing. I started to volunteer in the project activities and I was at the frontline to engage more in the project. But what attracted me most it was the involvement of TMA (Tanzania Meteorological Authority – Tanzania’s national meteorological organization). These are very professional and educated people but they decided to work closely with us to teach and ensure we understand all matters of weather and climate. It was amazing and I was later selected by Stella (at CCI) to be among 5 community members of Kigogo who were making SMS texts from the downscaled forecast we received from CCI and TMA to simplify the forecast in a language that the majority of our people here understood, and in turn, so we could send to 20 community members and reach most of our settlement. I am proud of that moment and up to now, I am still a good follower of these TMA information on a day-to-day basis as I can now quickly comment when the information is shared through DARAJA’s WhatsApp group.” Agnella was able to attend her work on time during rainy seasons and was paid without losing out. She had planned to work and earn a specific amount of money, approximately 150,000TZS ($60) that she later on used to repair the house and to raise a foundation of their house to reduce the floodwater to easily enter through their home. She further said, as a family which has low income and living at low-income community, they have been able to save some amount that they were losing in the past. But now Agnella and her family are taking preventative measures earlier and advising her fellow community members, especially neighbors, to take such measures so they won’t get affected by extreme weather on an individual or community basis. Furthermore, as a family, they have been able to help their father who is blind by helping him to move early to a safe place when their settlement is flooded.";Africa;Kenya, Tanzania;Nairobi, Dar es Salaam;100000;360000;Human Settlements Systems;The DARAJA initiative enhances climate resilience in informal urban settlements across Kenya and Tanzania by providing localized weather forecasting and early warning systems.

Regions4;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-tale-of-resilience-and-restoration-in-brazils-paraiba-do-sul-river-basin/;September 29, 2023;A tale of resilience and restoration in Brazil’s Paraíba do Sul River Basin;In the heart of Brazil, spanning across the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais, lies the Paraíba do Sul River Basin, a region that is home to some of the country’s largest industrial and population centres. Here, the water resources are a lifeline for over 14 million people, playing a crucial role in supplying water, generating electricity, diluting effluents, and serving various other purposes. However, the basin has witnessed extensive deforestation in the past, particularly during the 18th and 19th-century coffee cycle, leaving a significant portion of its territory covered by degraded and unproductive pastures. Amidst the escalating climate crisis and its associated impacts, the urgency for a transition to a low-carbon economy has never been more pressing. The government of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has stepped up to this challenge, setting an ambitious goal at COP26 to increase the forest coverage of the Atlantic Forest in the state from 30% to 40% by 2050. This translates to the restoration of an additional 440,000 hectares, with the potential to absorb 159 million tons of carbon dioxide. Propelling the delivery of this is the “Conexão Mata Atlântica” project, initiated in 2017 through a collaborative effort involving the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and the Federal Government, represented by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI). Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), along with matching funds from the state government, the project stands as a testament to the power of collective action. In Rio de Janeiro, the project has adopted an innovative approach focusing on Payments for Environmental Services (PES) to incentivize and value the environmental actions taken by rural producers in private areas. The objective is multifaceted – mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity, and ensuring water and food security, all while aiming to increase carbon stocks. The project has emerged as an effective strategy in preserving forests and recovering degraded areas, offering both economic and social benefits, and contributing to the environmental wellbeing of the region. PES investments in the project have totaled US$1.7 million, bringing about transformative changes for farming families. A total of 237 families have been compensated for their contributions to conserving and restoring nearly 2,440 hectares of land. These families, initially lacking funds or access to credit lines, were empowered by the project to adopt sustainable systems such as agroforestry and silvopastoral systems, where trees are planted at wide spacings into grazed pastures. These systems integrate native trees with crops and pasture, promoting environmental gains and increasing the income of producers. The Conexão Mata Atlântica project has not only expanded and strengthened the State Environmental Payment for Ecosystem Services Program – PRO-PSA but has also included seven more micro-watersheds and six municipalities in Rio de Janeiro that benefit from this initiative. The main beneficiaries of this project are rural landowners with limited financial capacity. The project has played a significant role in enhancing their resilience and wellbeing, fostering sustainable agricultural practices, and contributing to the overall development of the region. It has strengthened community organization, reduced the vulnerability of the beneficiaries’ production, especially in family farming, and promoted food and nutritional security through the Technological Leap and specialized consultations.

Insurance Development Forum;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/improving-urban-resilience-through-insurance-innovations-in-colombia/;September 21, 2023;The Medellín Project: A climate insurance success story;Amid the climate crisis, the city of Medellín, home to over 4 million people, finds itself increasingly vulnerable to floods and landslides. To combat these threats and provide swift financial assistance in times of need, the Medellín Project was initiated. Its core mission: bolster Medellín’s financial resilience against climate-related risks and natural disasters. In 2018, under a Tripartite Agreement – an initiative between the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) – co-funded by the InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF) and IDF implementation partners, namely WTW and Hannover Re, and the Medellín Administrative Department of Disaster Risk Management (DAGRD), embarked on a transformative two-year journey. Their goal was to fortify urban resilience, covering not only Medellin itself but also its 16 communes and 5 corregimientos, with the potential to benefit more than 4 million residents. The project’s cornerstone was parametric insurance, a flexible system where predetermined triggers, such as specific rainfall levels, instantly prompt financial aid without the need for lengthy damage assessments. Collaboration was pivotal, as was adaptability. Medellín’s government served as the policyholder, ensuring swift payouts without bureaucratic delays. Common challenges faced in developing parametric disaster insurance solutions in climate-vulnerable regions were navigated. The project shifted from reliance on satellite data to local sources, including firsthand accounts, seismic data from the Colombian Geological Service, and rainfall data from the Aburrá Valley Early Warning System. Regulatory obstacles were also addressed, with the project adapting to evolving insurance regulations and exploring alternative risk transfer mechanisms, such as financial derivatives. The outcome was a tailor-made insurance solution enveloping Medellín’s vulnerabilities. The Municipality of Medellín was engaged through the Municipal Fund for Disaster Risk Management (FONGRED). Technical expertise was developed, knowledge shared, and local barriers navigated. This project acted as the bridge connecting the insurance sector and the community’s needs, ultimately empowering the city to manage its own risk. The project yielded valuable lessons put in practice: Collaboration with local stakeholders. Understanding public administration dynamics is critical for a compliant insurance product. Centralized databases on historical climate hazards. Establishing a common language among all stakeholders Flexibility in adapting to emerging data and political environment. As the Medellín Project draws to a close, it leaves valuable learning from the potent partnership of public and private sectors. The project partners and implementers are eager to explore the replicability of similar financial solutions for other cities in Colombia, while exploring next steps for the future of the Tripartite Agreement. The IDF and its partners will be actively participating in COP28, sharing lessons learned to advance the role of non-state actors and public-private partnerships in delivering practical financial solutions for adaptation and resilience.

A focal point of this year’s event is “Adaptation and Resilience”, honouring the strides made since the Sharm El Sheikh Adaptation Agenda’s establishment and shining a spotlight on adaptation efforts across diverse systems. And right on cue, showcasing the city’s commitment to tackling the climate emergency, Manhattan’s East Side unveils the promising East Side Coastal Resiliency (ESCR) Project. Jointly funded by the City of New York and the federal government, the ESCR Project seeks to combat the flood risks faced by Manhattan’s East Side, stretching from East 25th Street to Montgomery Street. This critical area finds itself within the FEMA 100-year floodplain and houses a thriving community of over 110,000 New Yorkers. Crucially, the approach has been inclusive, a key priority for our work. The city has engaged local residents and community partners extensively, with public design workshops showcasing three-dimensional models and intricate drawings of various design options. This rich feedback, combined with insights from prior plans in the region, has shaped the ESCR vision. Key features: A 2.4-mile flood protection system, comprising floodwalls and floodgates, seamlessly weaving into the community. They’ll harmoniously integrate with local streets, East River Park, and the fresh landscapes of Corlears Hook Park, Murphy Brothers Playground, Stuyvesant Cove Park, and Asser Levy Playground. Significant upgrades to the underground drainage system to bolster the sewer system’s capacity. The ambitious project, amounting to $1.45 billion, is supported by a generous $338 million federal grant, with the City of New York covering the rest. Moreover, ESCR is but the inaugural step in a grander vision. While it operates as a distinct ‘compartment’ for flood risk reduction in its designated area, it will beautifully align with other resilient initiatives, paving the way for a fortified Lower Manhattan. Lessons from the past: In 2012, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on New York City, claiming 44 lives, crippling neighbourhoods, and causing damages to the tune of $19 billion. The Lower East Side bore a significant brunt. This disaster underscored the urgency for a comprehensive protective response, resulting in New York City spearheading a strategic assessment of climate vulnerabilities. On its completion, the ESCR Project promises more than just flood barriers. It envisions a robust, attractive corridor shielded against future climatic adversities. Set amidst a bustling urban backdrop, the ESCR is truly a unique endeavour. It goes beyond mere physical robustness, aiming for socio-economic resilience. The plan is more than just a protective measure—it’s about harmonizing the protective features with the community’s fabric. The goal is clear: protect without isolating. Furthermore, the project safeguards critical infrastructure, from pump stations to the power grid. Educational hubs like local schools and libraries also find protection under its umbrella. A resilient future. The ESCR doesn’t just aim to protect; it intends to enhance. The envisioned outcomes include: Protection against future storm surges and rising sea levels.

Insuresilience;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/nepal-protecting-farmers-with-flood-insurance/;August 17, 2023;Protecting farmers with flood insurance;"In the majestic shadows of the Himalayas lies Nepal, a country known for its breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural tapestry. But behind this beauty lies a pressing challenge: the persistent threat of natural disasters, particularly floods, which pose a grave risk to the nation’s farming community. To combat this, a coalition of organizations has embarked on a mission to shield these farmers with an innovative solution – index-based flood insurance. This initiative, grounded in collaboration and innovation, promises not only financial relief but also the hope of a more resilient future for Nepal’s agrarian heart. The issue Nepal’s farmers, who form the backbone of the nation, face many challenges, especially from natural disasters like floods, landslides, and windstorms. These calamities put their crops and livelihoods at risk. A group led by Practical Action is stepping in with a new solution: a specially designed flood insurance for the farmers living in flood-prone regions, mainly in western Nepal. Understanding Nepal’s vulnerability. Nepal, sandwiched between India and China in the Himalayas, has unique geographical features that make it prone to floods. The situation is worsening due to climate change. Significant portions of the population, over 65%, rely heavily on agriculture. Unfortunately, floods are frequent and can wreak havoc on their livelihoods. The goal is clear: find ways to help these communities withstand and recover from these disasters. Introducing the insurance solution:Local community-focused institutions, like microfinance groups and cooperatives, are central to this plan. They buy the flood insurance on behalf of their farmer members. This insurance has two main benefits: Immediate Payouts: When severe floods occur, the insurance uses specific measurements (like river flow rates) to determine payouts. This method speeds up the process, allowing farmers to get help faster. Educational Component: This insurance isn’t just about payouts; it also provides farming advice to help farmers mitigate losses. Roadblocks and solutions: Every solution faces challenges, and this one is no exception: Data Shortages: Some regions lack detailed flood data. To address this, the project currently focuses on areas with sufficient data. Meanwhile, the team collaborates with Nepal’s meteorological department to expand data collection. Awareness: Introducing new insurance concepts requires education. The team is working hard to educate farmers about the benefits and workings of this insurance, ensuring they can make informed decisions. Index-Based Flood Insurance (IBFI) is a simple, easy, and innovative way of risk transfer – as smallholder farmers will access their insured amount as soon as the indexes are met and soon after the flood crosses the pre-defined threshold. In this regard, IBFI is revolutionary in the insurance sector and many smallholder farmers are attracted to this scheme. Since cooperatives from the communities are policyholders on behalf of farmers, they trust the insurance scheme and have a positive outlook towards it.” – Dhundi Raj Rijal, Branch Manager, Shikhar Insurance Bardiya.

Initiative 20×20;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/reviving-brazils-babassu-a-sustainable-alternative-to-imported-palm-oil/;August 11, 2023;Reviving Brazil’s Babassu: A Sustainable Alternative to Imported Palm Oil;"As the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Summit (ACTO) closes, a spotlight shines on a ground-breaking initiative taking root in Brazil’s rural landscape. Race to Resilience partner, 20×20 is forging a trail toward a sustainable future by tapping into a native resource: the babassu palm tree. Forget imported palm oil; Brazil has embarked on a journey to cultivate a local alternative that’s not only environmentally friendly but also economically empowering. Working hand-in-hand with local communities, Initiative 20×20 is transforming the lives of 1,500 rural families through sustainable agroforestry practices. Imagine a Brazil where flourishing babassu palms signal not just thriving ecosystems but thriving communities as well. Read on to explore how this ambitious project is sowing the seeds for a greener and more resilient future, one babassu palm at a time. The babassu (Attalea speciosa) is a species of palm tree that thrives on the peripheries of the three major types of Brazilian forests: the Amazon, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado. Babaçuais, as these unique forests are known, cover about 20 million hectares of Brazilian territory, mainly in the states of Maranhão, Tocantins and Piaui. This hardy tree not only grows in dense closed forests, it also acts as a pioneer species that can help colonize degraded and deforested areas, helping other species take root. The babassu is also an economic asset: Its coconuts produce rich oil and strong plant fibre. From the late 1980s, however, babassu production has suffered a continual decline. The spread of intensive agriculture and livestock production destroyed the babaçuais forests, and the introduction of cheap, imported palm oil from Asian producers replaced babassu oil as the key ingredient in Brazil’s personal care, perfumery and cosmetics industry. Some local producers closed down, threatening the livelihoods of the more than 200,000 people who depended on the babassu industry. Tobasa Bioindustrial de Babaçu, a certified B Corporation, was founded in the late 1960s with a mission to invest in new technologies to make babassu coconut production more efficient. Tobasa separates the various parts of the babassu coconut and finds a commercial destination for each of its components. For Tobasa, less waste means more profit and less environmental impact. Today, Tobasa is the only industrial complex of its kind in Brazil. The company produces activated carbon for use in residential and industrial water filters, bioalcohol for use in the cosmetic and beverage industries, and other babassu by-products like meal, which is used for animal feed. To ensure that its supply is both of good quality and consistent, Tobasa works closely with the local communities who harvest babassu palms. Babassu harvesters formerly could only sell the valuable inner nut, which is only 6 percent of the total mass of the coconut, but, thanks to technological innovation, Tobasa can now use the entire coconut to produce goods for the market. By buying the whole coconuts, both the nut and the shell, Tobasa ensures that farmers get the most out of what they harvest. Kaeté Investimentos, an Initiative 20×20 financial partner, became a partner of Tobasa in 2016. Through its Multi-Strategy Sustainable Investment Fund for the Amazon, Kaeté has invested R$8 million (US$2.2 million) in the project, with the objective of improving the industrial process and increasing production capacity. Kaeté’s investment has allowed Tobasa to expand its operations and the number of its babassu harvesters it works with. As of 2018, Tobasa now buys babassu coconuts from over 120,000 hectares in the region, benefitting thousands of local producers. Since 2016 alone, its reach has expanded by 60 percent, and the company has begun to work with an additional 1,500 families. The more babassu that local communities produce, the more income they generate. In this way, Tobasa indirectly incentivizes farmers to plant trees and restore degraded land throughout the region. The area managed by the Tobasa-affiliated communities already stores more than 19 million tons of CO2 and sequesters an additional 1 million tons per year. If more land is restored to meet growing domestic demand for plant oils, more carbon will be stored and more communities will benefit.";South America;Brazil;São Luís;-2539110;-44282905;Water and Nature Systems;In Brazil, the sustainable babassu palm initiative, spearheaded by Initiative 20×20 with Tobasa Bioindustrial de Babaçu and Kaeté Investimentos, is revitalizing the babassu industry as an eco-friendly alternative to imported palm oil. Centered in states like Maranhão, with São Luís as a key city, this project is transforming the lives of 1,500 rural families across 120,000 hectares. Tobasa's innovative approach, utilizing every part of the babassu coconut, bolsters local economies and supports environmental conservation. With a USD 2.2 million investment, the initiative not only enhances the local industry but also aids in carbon storage and land restoration.;"Babassu palm; agroforestry; sustainable development; rural empowerment; carbon storage"
Global Mangrove Alliance;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/the-guardians-of-the-mangrove-forest-in-west-kalimantan-indonesia/;August 7, 2023;The Guardians of the Mangrove Forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia;"Imagine a world where 15 million people are safer from storms and flooding, where 4.1 million small-scale fishers have a secure livelihood, and where 25 billion fish and shellfish thrive. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s what could be achieved through the restoration of the world’s mangroves. On 26 July, we celebrated International Mangroves Day, not only as an opportunity to reflect on these incredible ecosystems but a reminder of the unbreakable bond between humanity and nature. Mangroves are nature’s shield against the wrath of rising seas and storm surges, especially for vulnerable coastal communities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developing Countries (LDCs). They are not just barriers; they are nurseries for marine life, carbon sinks, and symbols of culture and tradition. According to the State of the World’s Mangroves Report 2022: 8,183km² of mangroves can be restored globally. Restoring half of these would: Generate over 25 billion commercially vital fish and shellfish every year. Support millions of fishers and countless communities. Sequester carbon equivalent to 1.27 gigatons of CO2. Reduce flood risk to some 15 million people yearly. But it’s in the local communities where these statistics come to life. In the coastal villages of West Kalimantan, the devastation of once-thriving mangrove forests, essential to the livelihood of countless local fishers, has ignited a movement for restoration and rejuvenation. This effort is not merely about rebuilding a marine life habitat but reconnecting with a part of the community’s identity. Spearheaded by community members and supported by local governments, national authorities, Planet Indonesia, and the Global Mangrove Alliance, among others, efforts are underway to reconstruct what was lost. By blending modern scientific knowledge with traditional insights, villagers are nurturing the mangroves as symbols of their cultural heritage. In Sungai Nibong, a village with 1,318 inhabitants where 40 percent are fishermen, the livelihoods are intimately tied to healthy mangroves. Reviving the green mangrove barrier signifies not only a resurgence in economic prosperity but also an improvement in the community’s income and livelihood. Residents are also eager to develop a bioeconomy, creating products like mangrove honey and syrup. One local villager poignantly notes, “It’s not just about the trees and tides; it’s about our tomorrow, our children’s legacy.” Specific regulations have been created to protect the mangroves, including the declaration of a Marine and Coastal Protected Area in Sungai Nibung Village. Penalties have been set for mangrove destruction: if a resident destroys a mangrove tree, they must plant 10 seedlings in return. The positive impact of mangrove restoration is extending to other West Kalimantan communities such as North Kayong, Ketapang, Mempawah, Sambas, Singkawang, Kubu Raya, and Bengkayang. These villages have restored 789 hectares of mangrove forests, with the Indonesian government’s Peat and Mangrove Restoration Agency’s support under a program seeking to restore 3.3 million hectares by 2024. In the West Kalimantan region alone, the target is to restore at least 1,000 hectares. Setting a global target to catalyse and measure action. Recognizing this potential, the Sharm El Sheikh Adaptation Agenda (SAA) takes these localized successes and amplifies them into a global commitment. Its landmark outcome focused on Coastal and Ocean Systems has set a target to see USD $4 billion invested to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves globally. This initiative is monumental in its scope, encompassing efforts to halt mangrove loss, restore half of recent losses, double the protection of mangroves globally, and ensure sustainable long-term finance for all existing mangroves. Leading this effort, The Global Mangrove Alliance launched the Mangrove Restoration Tracking Tool. This innovative tool provides critical support to restoration efforts by offering real-time data and insights. It enables the tracking of restoration projects, assists in evaluating their effectiveness, and identifies areas where improvement and scaling can occur. Unlike many technological solutions, this tool isn’t confined to experts; it’s designed for accessibility, allowing anyone with an interest in mangroves to engage with the data. By making this information transparent and widely available, it supports a collaborative approach to restoration, engaging communities, governments, and organizations alike. The Tracking Tool will allow the work of local communities, governments and organizations to be accounted for and support in tracking the success of restoration globally. Join the movement.

Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/dhaka-north-becomes-the-first-city-in-asia-to-appoint-a-chief-heat-officer/#:~:text=Under%20this%20joint%20initiative%2C%20the,them%20living%20in%20urban%20centers.;August 7, 2023;Dhaka North becomes the first city in Asia to appoint a Chief Heat Officer;"With temperatures rising in Asia at twice the rate of the global average and as cities prepare for another intense heat season, Mayor Atiqul Islam of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), Bangladesh, is leading the way to become an official member of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center’s (Arsht-Rock) Global Champions for Heat Action platform, an initiative to help cities across the world tackle the challenges of extreme urban heat. Under this joint initiative, the first of its kind in Asia, Bushra Afreen has been appointed as the city’s first-ever “Chief Heat Officer” (CHO). By 2050, heat waves will affect the lives and livelihood of more than 3.5 billion people worldwide – half of them living in urban centers. Extreme heat poses a major threat to cities and will continue to grow more dangerous each year. North Dhaka is particularly vulnerable to the urban heat island effect due to its densely populated urban core, with hotspots in the city more than 10°C higher than the surrounding countryside. These extreme heat conditions are threating lives and causing labor productivity losses greater than 8 percent of the city’s annual output. With the number of dangerously hot days estimated to double by 2050, the impacts of extreme heat will grow exponentially – with a greater burden falling on women and girls. As CHO, Afreen will be responsible for leading efforts to make her city safer in the face of extreme heat. By unifying North Dhaka’s city-wide planning and responses to extreme heat, she will accelerate existing heat awareness and protection efforts, and initiate new work to reduce the risks and impacts of extreme heat for its 15 million residents, particularly its most vulnerable neighborhoods and people. “I’m thrilled to join a global movement of city leaders and experts committed to protecting people and communities from extreme heat in my city” said Afreen. “As a native of Dhaka, I know firsthand the urgent need for action to address this growing danger, where temperatures are rising at an alarming rate, and informal communities, migrants, and women and girls, are disproportionately affected. Every day, two thousand people move to Dhaka, and 70 percent of them do so because of climate-related disasters.” Afreen brings a breadth of experience and expertise to her role as North Dhaka’s first-ever Chief Heat Officer. With a background in social welfare, government, and micro-finance and innovation, Afreen is well-positioned to address the challenges posed by extreme heat in the region. Prior to her appointment, Afreen served as the Executive of Social Welfare at her family’s export-oriented garment business in Asulia, Bangladesh. In this capacity, she oversaw the implementation of measures to support and champion working mothers, including the provision of company-sponsored feeding rooms, child-care, and daycare facilities. Not content with just improving the welfare of working mothers, Afreen established a task force to reduce heat on production floors and developed sustainable fashion options for clients. Afreen’s expertise also extends to micro-finance schemes and field management from her time at the Shakti Foundation. Afreen studied global development at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario in Canada, and spent a year in Ghana studying culture and local government. “Today is a special day in my city. I am proud to announce the first Chief Heat Officer for Dhaka North City Corporation – and the first in Asia,” said Mayor Atiqul Islam. “Our city and its residents face extreme heat at every turn and our communities’ most vulnerable need protection from this climate-driven threat that is robbing people of their health and livelihoods. With the appointment of CHO Bushra Afreen, I am confident we can bring awareness and solutions for a safer, cooler Dhaka.” “Extreme heat is acting like a pressure cooker on cities all over the world, and as populations bulge in places like North Dhaka, a Chief Heat Officer is essential,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, Senior Vice President, and Director of Arsht-Rock. “Bushra Afreen’s role can serve as a model for cities all over South Asia – and Arsht-Rock is proud to be her partner and co-deliver solutions for protecting communities across NDCC.” Shakti Foundation will be collaborating with Afreen to develop inclusive solutions to extreme heat. As a key local partner to Arsht-Rock and the DNCC, they have worked for the past forty years to alleviate poverty for underprivileged women across Bangladesh. Shakti will provide strategic and administrative support to the initiative. “Shakti Foundation is seeing the effects of heat across our 400,000 plus female clients throughout Bangladesh, especially in highly urbanized informal settlements,” said Sohani Huq Elian, Director, Climate Change Program. “We are pleased to be a partner in this exciting global initiative led by Arsht-Rock Resilience Center that brings a Chief Heat Officer to Dhaka and accelerates our efforts to protect people as the city continues to heat and grow.”Mayor Islam and Dhaka North are the seventh mayor and city, respectively, to create a Chief Heat Officer as part of the City Champions for Heat Action initiative, closely following founding members in Miami-Dade County, U.S.; Athens, Greece; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Santiago, Chile; Monterrey, Mexico; and Melbourne, Australia.

Efficiency for Access;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/harvesting-the-sun-how-solar-energy-transformed-a-kenyan-herb-farm/;July 20, 2023;Harvesting the Sun: How Solar Energy Transformed a Kenyan Herb Farm;In a lead-up to announcing this year’s Global LEAP Off-Grid Cold Chain Challenge (OGCCC) finalists, a team from Efficiency for Access visited two Kenya-based field testing participants. The first visit was to a family-owned agribusiness situated in Thika, a bustling agricultural and industrial town about an hour’s drive from Nairobi. The team was eager to have a first-hand view of the Solar Cooling Engineering cold room in use and learn more about the owner’s experience. On arrival in Thika town, we drove about 20 minutes into a lush residential estate where Kamau Mbarire and his wife, Jane, warmly welcomed us. The couple jointly run a profitable and growing herbs-for-export business, Jungle Harvest Limited, with Jane more actively involved in the day-to-day operations. Jane holding a freshly cut basil plant in her greenhouse. As the team explored the 0.75 acres of land under cultivation, Jane told us of her family’s nearly two-decade-long journey of establishing their now-thriving business. Since occupying the property, Jane’s family has tried their hand in various ventures, including dairy, pig, and poultry farming and producing bananas, avocadoes, vegetables and strawberries. Of the initial pursuits, strawberries had been the most successful. Unfortunately, the success of the strawberries was short-lived — with wild monkeys in the neighbourhood stealing the ripe strawberries before she could gather them for sale. Deterred but not defeated, Jane erected a greenhouse where she would plant the strawberries away from the cheeky thieves. However, this solution did not last as the strawberries were not thriving under the canopy of the greenhouse. She also noted that the quality of the fruit did not match earlier harvests when the strawberries were planted under direct sunlight. This led to her exploring herb growing in 2018, which has proven less susceptible to the interference of the monkeys. The family now grows several herbs, including basil, coriander, dill, mint, rosemary, sage, tarragon and thyme. Since settling on their cash crop of choice, the family shifted their sights to how best they could maximize the farm’s income generation. Following a recommendation from their son Francis (a Graduate in AgroEcosystems and Environment Management), Jane and Kamau chose to invest in an on-site cold storage facility in late 2021. They received financing for the Solar Cooling Engineering brand cold room through a loan which they are currently servicing. Before purchasing the cold room, they had to hire refrigerated trucks to keep their produce fresh for transport. This was not a sustainable approach for them. It involved their workers spending long hours during harvest days to ensure all orders were sorted and packed in time for the scheduled pick up and delivery. It was also costly, with daily truck hires averaging USD $60–77. Now, with the cold room, Jane can store over 1000 kilograms of herbs for up to a week and take more time to sort and pack the product for transport to the airport. We have been using it day in, day out. It has really helped us because we are growing herbs that are very sensitive to high temperatures. We can harvest today, tomorrow and the next day, and the herbs remain fresh” — Jane Kamau. Jane and Kamau are no strangers to solar. They have been using a SunCulture solar water pump to irrigate their crops since 2015. “With solar, we are good to go anytime,” Jane remarked. Since acquiring the cold room, Jane and Kamau’s herb capacity has grown from about 50–80 kgs to over 300kgs, nearly doubling their income from the farm. With their increased output, they now supply higher value export clients with larger orders instead of local clients who make small orders fetching lower returns. The family also appreciate that the precise temperature control of the cold room enables herb preservation in optimal conditions, meeting the high export quality standards. Dan, the Farm Manager, supervises two young ladies weeding newly planted thyme. Not only has the cold room benefited Jane and Kamau’s bottom line, but it has also enabled them to empower their local community. Jane mentioned that, aside from Dan, the farm manager, she prefers to employ young single mothers on the farm. In this way, the young mothers can earn an income to support themselves and their children. Additionally, Jane distributes fresh vegetables to neighbouring households which she purchases in bulk and stores in the cold room, generating some extra income. CLASP team member, Ruth Kimani examines a component of the cold room. Jane and Kamau confirmed that the cold room has been a worthy investment and a means of further expanding their business. With the extra income brought about by the cold room, they are constructing a larger herb propagation shed and plan to lease land from their neighbours, extending their farm by about an acre. With these plans in place, they will grow more herbs, take up larger orders and expand the business. “At least now with the cold room, we are able to do more propagation and grow as many crops as possible…It was a worthwhile investment.” — Jane Kamau.;Africa;Kenya;Thika;-1038756;37083375;Food Security and Agriculture Systems;Jungle Harvest Limited, liderado por Jane y Kamau Mbarire en Thika, Kenia, ha revolucionado su negocio de cultivo de hierbas con almacenamiento frío alimentado por energía solar.

Ocean Risk Resilience Alliance (ORRAA),  Insurance Development Forum (IDF) &  Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment (CCRI);2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/how-innovative-insurance-solutions-are-protecting-mesoamerican-reefs-and-communities/;July 6, 2023;How innovative insurance solutions are protecting Mesoamerican reefs and communities;In the ever-expanding field of climate resilience, innovation is key. 2021 marked a significant milestone in this journey, as Willis Towers Watson (WTW) and the Mesoamerican Reef Fund (MAR Fund) joined forces to create the world’s first multinational parametric insurance cover for hurricane risk. This project, dubbed the MAR Insurance Programme, is a brilliant interweaving of finance and climate risk management. Its purpose is to protect the Mesoamerican Reef – an ecological lifeline for Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. Communities here rely on the reef for protection, food security, and livelihoods, with nearly 2 million beneficiaries at its core. Inception of the MAR Insurance Programme came with the backing of the Canadian government via Race to Resilience partner, the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), and continuous support from the German government through the InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF). The insurance programme now covers key reef sites across these countries. The parametric mechanism – a cutting-edge concept in the insurance world – activates pay-outs after a qualifying hurricane event, providing financial resources for reef response brigades. AXA Climate, as the initial underwriter, was integral in launching this ambitious effort. The success of the programme lies in its focus on rapid response. The goal is simple: conserve and restore the reef system as swiftly as possible following a hurricane. It proved its worth during its second year, when it not only expanded coverage to a total of seven sites but also added Munich Re as a second underwriter. The first real test came with Category 1 Hurricane Lisa. The storm passed over Belize’s Turneffe Atoll, triggering the programme’s first pay-out. Within 14 days, insurers transferred $175,000 to the MAR Fund, which was able to mobilize the Turneffe Atoll Sustainability Association in under 48 hours. This rapid response and allocation of funds underscore the value of a pre-arranged, trigger-based mechanism like parametric insurance in responding to climate emergencies. The experience also offered valuable insights, leading to further refinement of the parametric structure to optimize premium use based on the local capacity of reef responders. The programme continues to evolve and recently expanded to cover 11 protected reef sites across the Mesoamerican Reef region. ISF and the UN Development Programme provided premium support, and AXA Climate returned as the insurer following a competitive process. The ripple effect of the MAR Programme’s success is already being felt, with replication projects springing up across various geographies including the broader Caribbean and the Pacific. These new initiatives are also tackling additional climate hazards, such as ocean heat waves and extreme rainfall-induced terrestrial runoff. WTW collaborates with local partners in these projects to ensure that pay-out use cases are tailored to their respective contexts – from immediate reef response to food and water provisions for affected communities, to compensating fishermen to reduce pressure on the reefs. The innovative application of parametric insurance is also evident in the creation of the world’s first sovereign debt “resilience wrapper” as part of Belize’s 2021 private debt conversion. This mechanism safeguards Belize’s blue bond debt servicing payments following major hurricane events, relieving financial stress on the Government of Belize and freeing up funds for immediate disaster response. This has fortified the economy’s resilience, leading to a significant reduction in the cost of capital, evident in a lower interest rate on privately held sovereign debt and a significant improvement in the sovereign credit rating, thereby enhancing Belize’s investment proposition. The work undertaken by WTW, the MAR Fund, and their partners is proof that with innovative financial instruments and commitment, it is possible to build a future where communities and ecosystems are better equipped to handle the challenges posed by the climate crisis. As we chart our path into this uncertain future, the model they’ve created offers a way to anticipate and mitigate risks, turning the tide in our favour in the Race to Resilience.;North America;Belize;Belize City;17504566;-88196213;"Ocean and Coastal Systems; Cross Cutting: Finance";The MAR Insurance Programme, in collaboration with Willis Towers Watson and the Mesoamerican Reef Fund, offers innovative insurance solutions for the Mesoamerican Reef across Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Cities Race to Resilience ;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/building-coastal-resilience-in-portsmouth-a-city-under-siege-by-the-sea/;June 27, 2023;Building coastal resilience in Portsmouth: A city under siege by the sea;"Portsmouth, a historic city on England’s southern coast, finds itself on the front line of the climate crisis. The city’s venerable coastal defences, many reaching the end of their serviceable lives, are under threat from rising sea levels and increased coastal flooding. Portsmouth’s dual-fronted battle against time and tide reveals a city galvanized, innovating and adapting to safeguard its future. Here we explore Portsmouth’s bold moves, providing a blueprint for coastal cities worldwide grappling with similar threats. The coastal city of Portsmouth is under siege. The city’s North Portsea Island and Southsea regions, each with their unique topographies and ageing defence systems, face increasing flood risk due to climate change. The city’s coastal heritage, including its Scheduled Ancient Monuments such as the 17th-century Long Curtain Moat, Kings Bastion, Spur Redoubt, and the historic Southsea Castle, is also at risk. The forecasted sea-level rise of one meter by 2100 could inundate the majority of the existing defences annually, a stark reminder of the growing urgency. In response, Portsmouth launched the Southsea Coastal Scheme, the UK’s largest local authority-led coastal defence project. This ambitious project aims to protect 10,000 homes and 704 commercial properties over the next century. More than just a robust defensive mechanism, the scheme blends its components seamlessly into the city’s landscape, preserving Portsmouth’s unique character, and safeguarding its cherished historical sites. The project’s six sub-frontages – Long Curtain Moat, Clarence Pier, Southsea Common, Southsea Castle, South Parade Pier, and Canoe Lake – are designed with mixed defences strategically blended with existing structures and significant historical assets. Portsmouth’s resilience project stands as a testament to innovation. Artificial tide pools, mimicking natural ecosystems found on rocky coastlines, are installed to promote marine life colonization. Recycling is a priority; materials from existing structures are reused in new sea defences, minimizing waste. The scheme balances robust defence with a commitment to environmental sustainability, ensuring Portsmouth’s coastline remains a haven for both its human and marine residents. The North Portsea Island scheme. The North Portsea Island flood defence scheme, covering 8.4km of Portsmouth’s coastline, is designed to provide a ‘1 in 500 year’ standard of protection against flooding. The scheme includes a specially textured seawall, which, once established, will provide a platform for local marine species to thrive. This approach proves that adapting to climate change can coexist with enhancing biodiversity. Portsmouth’s initiatives have not gone unnoticed. The city is now part of the Cities Race to Resilience, a global initiative to rally cities towards building climate resilience. Portsmouth committed to a broad climate risk and vulnerability assessment, aiming to fully understand the climate risks to its residents, businesses, and public services, from which a climate change adaptation action plan will be developed. Through its efforts, Portsmouth envisions creating resilient spaces that are safe, environmentally sustainable, and socially inclusive. They are not only combating climate change but also enhancing the cityscape with increased provisions for cyclists and pedestrians.

International Coalition for Sustainable Infrastructure;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/how-oysters-are-helping-protect-apalachicolas-vulnerable-shoreline/;June 22, 2023;How Oysters Are Helping Protect Apalachicola's Vulnerable Shoreline;"This nature-based solution involves creating up to 20 acres of engineered oyster reefs and up to 30 acres of salt marshes to attenuate wave action and help protect the vulnerable coastline and critical infrastructure from erosion. The project also provides ecological uplift through oyster repopulation, habitat enhancement and improved water quality. About the project. A 6-mile segment of Highway 98 that traverses Apalachicola Bay on the Florida panhandle lies directly beside the water’s edge. Wave energy, rising tides and severe storms make this stretch of shoreline, and the adjacent roadway infrastructure, particularly vulnerable to chronic erosion. Due to the importance of this highway as a designated hurricane evacuation route, millions of dollars have been spent trying to protect the roadway. Over the years, efforts have been undertaken to stabilise the shoreline using various types of armouring, including vertical concrete seawalls, rock rip-rap, concrete rubble and articulated-concrete block mats. However, the shoreline and critical waterfront asset have continued to sustain damage. Unlike natural habitats, such as oyster reefs and salt marshes, man-made armouring is unable to repair itself after being damaged by waves. Taking this into account, the Apalachee Regional Planning Council (ARPC) partnered with WSP USA to explore a different approach involving design and implementation of a living shoreline project. The nature-based solution involves establishing an intertidal marsh through the introduction of oyster reefs to attenuate wave energy. As one of the largest oyster fisheries in the United States, the economy and ecology of Apalachicola Bay have always been closely intertwined — the oyster fishery has suffered significant decline in recent decades and nearly total collapse in 2012. The project will enhance ecological functions of the coastal habitats and help to restore the hard-hit oyster fishery, while also building the resilience of the shoreline and infrastructure, and enhancing recreation opportunities in the area. Initially, WSP assisted ARPC in developing the project concept and prepared grant applications. ARPC was awarded funding for the project through National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Emergency Coastal Resilience Fund and Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund programmes. WSP then completed an initial Coastal Conditions Analysis and gathered field data needed to support the design including ecological surveys, geotechnical data, and elevation surveys, and are providing design, construction support and monitoring through 2024. Intended outcomes. The project provides added protection to Highway 98, a critical disaster evacuation route, as well as the primary access to education, jobs and services for area residents, and for emergency services vehicles to reach residents. Environmental benefits are numerous; the establishment of the saltmarsh habitat supports carbon sequestration. Saltmarshes absorb and store large quantities of carbon dioxide that contribute to the effects of climate change. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “mangroves and salt marshes remove carbon from the atmosphere at a rate 10 times greater than tropical forests” and “store three to five imes more carbon per acre than tropical forests.” Additionally, the engineered oyster reef system establishes a foundation for the oyster population to proliferate and build resilience to wave action and storm surge. The oysters also clean the water and serve as a food source, while the salt marshes provide habitat for birds, fish, crabs and other species. Local communities will benefit from increased resilience of the shoreline and adjacent critical infrastructure, ecological uplift provided by the improved marine habitat, environmental co-benefits of improved water quality and biodiversity, and economic benefits of a restored oyster fishery.";North America;United States;Franklin County, Florida;29781774;-84856793;"Infrastructure Systems; Ocean and Coastal Systems";In Apalachicola Bay, Florida, a nature-based solution involving the creation of engineered oyster reefs and salt marshes is being implemented to protect the vulnerable coastline and critical infrastructure from erosion.

Build Change;2023;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/turning-money-into-mortar-transforming-the-housing-landscape-in-disaster-prone-philippines/;June 15, 2023;Turning money into mortar: Transforming the housing landscape in disaster-prone Philippines;"Nestled in the heart of the Pacific, the Philippines holds an ominous title: The World’s Most Disaster-Prone Country. Year after year, the nation battles against an unending torrent of typhoons, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. In 2019, a sobering estimate by Race to Resilience partner Build Change, revealed over 15 million precarious homes in urgent need of attention, most of them sheltering the country’s economically marginalized families. Just the following year, nature’s wrath laid bare the vulnerability of the Filipino people, affecting over 5 million lives and destroying more than 425,000 homes. In this context, Build Change initiated a transformative concept: Resilient Housing. Beyond simply standing against the elements, resilient homes serve as bastions of security and prosperity, enhancing the occupants’ wealth, health, and well-being. These homes are more than mere structures; they save lives, safeguard possessions, generate jobs, and fuel local economies. They are a long-term, cost-effective response to the severe housing deficit, preventing livelihood losses, forced migration, and displacement in the wake of disasters. In 2014, Build Change began a journey to strengthen Philippine homes, infusing engineering, technology, and innovative financing to create over 4,000 resilient buildings. This endeavour unearthed a significant market appetite for retrofitting loans, proving that low-income families could indeed afford these improvements. Further, it illuminated the willingness of private financial institutions to champion this cause, paving the way for resilient housing loan products. Capitalizing on the robust microfinance landscape of the Philippines, Build Change forged partnerships with six Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). These partnerships aim to elevate living standards by providing localized financial services. Institutions like Kabuhayan sa Ganap na Kasarinlan Credit and Savings Cooperative, Alalay sa Kaunlaran Inc., Country Builders Bank, ASA Philippines, RB Gattaran, and Ahon sa Hirap Inc., have responded to the call. Together, they have developed resilient housing loans attainable for low-income families and implemented home fortification projects from Albay to Bulacan. This collaborative mission strives to enhance the MFIs’ technical prowess, strengthen their housing loan resources, and mitigate lending risks. By engaging bigger, more financially capable lenders with a higher risk tolerance, Build Change aims to invigorate the mainstream financial market, funnelling more extensive resources into the hands of the MFIs. Build Change’s commitment to refining these microfinance products ensures they continually address homeowner’s needs. To this end, the organization has introduced an incremental approach featuring multiple loans and reinforcement stages, making home improvements more economically manageable. It’s experimenting with schemes to fund the construction of new homes. The impact of this revolution is palpable. By making strengthening 4,000 buildings, Build Change has ensured the safety of over 45,000 individuals through more resilient homes and schools. Its efforts have instigated a change in mindset for homeowners and builders, training more than 14,000 people in safe construction practices and creating 3,500 jobs. Women constitute 95% of the borrowers in this program, and the repayment rate exceeds 99%, a testament to the success, inclusivity, and potential of this model to reshape housing finance for global disaster and climate resilience. This project is expected to be replicated in Indonesia, so hundreds of women can secure resilient housing, making families and communities safer. In the words of Janet Hombria, a homeowner transformed by this initiative, “We’re no longer afraid of future calamities. We know we’re safe in our house.”";Asia;Philippines;Manila;14599512;120984222;"Infrastructure Systems; Human Settlements Systems; Cross Cutting: Finance";Build Change's initiative in the Philippines, particularly evident in Manila, focuses on creating resilient housing to counteract the nation’s vulnerability to natural disasters.

Vulnerable populations on the frontlines of climate impacts are often those already suffering from difficult living conditions, such as poverty and limit access to natural resources. For instance, water scarcity and extreme weather events such as droughts and heat waves, can exacerbate disparities and impede access to water and sanitation, directly increasing the risk of water contamination and proliferation of pathogens and diseases. To date, in India alone, around 50 million people continue to be unable to access proper sanitation. In rural India, only 50% of schools have adequate toilets for boys and girls affecting access to education. Moreover, lack of sanitation disproportionately impacts children under two years old, who account for 13% of all deaths per year by diarrhoea linked to water-borne diseases caused by poor sanitation and open-air defecation. The climate crisis and its effects on water scarcity is already impeding advancement of sanitation that relies on traditional resource-consuming sewage infrastructure. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the social enterprise Banka BioLoo, partner to Resilience First and Race to Resilience, is determined to reach remote India with sanitation using innovative climate-friendly technology. The Banka BioLoo bio-toilets are affordable, easy to install, required very little maintenance and have a life span of 35 years. The bio-toilets consist of a bio-digester tank attached to a toilet seat with a pre-fabricated shelter. One single Bio-toilet can reduce 90% of solid waste as it does not require a septic tank or external sewage, while at the same time is capable of generating recycled water suitable for gardening, and colourless, odourless biogas that can be used as energy for activities like cooking or heating. Banka BioLoo has installed 10,000 bioloos in 22 Indian states over the last eight years and has made a core part of its purpose to increase the education of people through capacity-building programs that build the understanding of the nexus between good hygiene, health and the environment. “Our bio-digester technology makes it possible for users to manage waste on site and reduce dependency on resource-consuming sewage infrastructure while decreasing the risk of sanitation-related diseases” Banka BioLoo. The company is also championing efforts to improve the quality of life and dignity of children. Banka BioLoo has provided 1,500 schools with bio-toilets across India. This support has led to an increase in health conditions for school children, the reduction of waterborne diseases, a major cause of mortality among children, and the increase in school attendance of girls during their menstruation cycle, as adequate access to sanitation allows female students to better manage their menstrual health. “The biggest opportunities for value creation must include developing sustainable strategies and outcomes”.

According to the European Environmental Agency, the continent is facing its warmest decade on record, with an average temperature increase of 1.11ºC to 1.14ºC warmer than pre-industrial levels. This is translating into more frequent, lasting, and intense heat waves. As heat waves become more extreme, so do their impacts on the people and the economy. It is estimated that heat waves are the number one cause of death related to climate disasters. The World Health Organization announced that in 2022, approximately 15,000 died across Europe due to extremely hot weather, evidencing the urgency to prioritize and address the impacts of extreme heat. Race to Resilience partner, Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance (EHRA), is aiming to support 500 million people worldwide with heat-related resilience solutions by 2030. One of the cities that have joined this effort is Athens, Greece, a city on high alert, suffering from multi hazard risks in relation to heat waves and wildfires. Impacts include poor air quality which disrupts water supplies, electricity transmission and generation, among others. In addition, Athens’ extreme heat is projected to become three times more frequent under current emission trajectories, increasing exposure and therefore, the vulnerability of its population and the economy. “Output losses due to heat-related worker productivity reductions in Central Athens alone are now valued at $98.4. This will rise to $230 million by 2050”. EHRA, 2022. To change this projection, the city of Athens has taken it upon itself to incorporate the following initiatives to counteract rising temperatures and their devastating impacts: On the policy front, Athens has appointed a Chief Heat Office to oversee workers’ protection in the city and put in place policies that ensure their safety during heat waves and peak hours. Campaigning to raise public awareness about heat waves’ consequences to health, providing timely information for rapid response and making accessible public cooling centres available for people during heatwaves. Investing in the built environment and nature-based solutions. Among the plans is a drive to increase green spaces by developing pocket parks that maintain cooling areas for wildlife and people, and create more water fountains to provide accessible water in public areas.;Europe;Greece;Athens;37983810;23727539;"Infrastructure Systems; Cross Cutting: Planning";Athens, Greece, is actively combating the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves and their impacts, supported by the Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance.

Cities Race to Resilience;2022;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/lusaka-zambia-the-african-city-championing-climate-resilience-through-solid-waste-management-swm/;November 30, 2022;Lusaka, Zambia: The African City Championing Climate Resilience Through Solid Waste Management (SWM);As dense hotspots of rapid social, economic and environmental change, cities can be key to driving sustainable, low-emission development. However, cities specifically in the Global South are often overlooked, characterised by, among other things, expanding informal settlements, high rates of unemployment and weak local economies. As torchbearers leading the fight against climate-related impacts and disasters, Cities Race to Resilience signatories from Africa have demonstrated their commitment to implementing adaptation and resilience actions across different aspects of urban planning. This has led to commitments across nature-based solutions, water and waste management, community engagement (and the participation of those most vulnerable to climate change), and governance. Cities Race to Resilience aims to ensure that city voices are put front and centre and heard at the highest international level of climate change negotiations. It also strives to ensure that climate resilience goals are treated with the same urgency as mitigation. One city in the initiative is Lusaka in Zambia. Among the main climate challenges facing the capital city are extreme weather events including drought and severe flooding, especially in the rainfall season. In addition to climate change impacts, Lusaka also faces increasing population growth, with a growing peri-urban population living in informal settlements. Particular vulnerabilities experienced in these peri-urban settings, unrelated to weather hazards, are exacerbated by climate change. For example, key risk factors for cholera in Lusaka include the increase in waste produced by a growing peri-urban population living in informal settlements, which might result in blocked drains, which plays a significant role in driving up flood risk, and hence health risks related to standing water – such as cholera. Because a high proportion (70%) of Lusaka’s population lives in informal settlements, waste management in the city is a significant challenge when it comes to these weather-related hazards. Areas may become inaccessible, meaning that door-to-door collections cannot be made, and waste will not be collected by services. For this reason, Lusaka has a strong solid waste management (SWM) programme in place, that includes monthly clean-ups in the city which sees the Mayor’s office work directly with ward councillors as well as communities to clean out drainage systems. Part of this locally-led activity includes a desensitisation programme, whereby the community, including youth, are educated on the issues around waste and climate-related flooding. This action ties in directly with the city’s commitment to improving community engagement and working with citizens to build resilience. Lusaka City Council (LCC) is responsible for the formulation of city by-laws and carries out direct sweeping, waste collection, and transportation of waste to the final disposal site services. The city has engaged with private operators and community-based enterprises (CBE) to ensure proper solid waste collection and disposal. Another issue remains the separation of waste and specifically the removal of organic (mostly food) waste. The Council is also working closely with the University of Zambia to address this issue and understand the potential of the organic waste market. By undertaking research with partners from the university, the LCC is working to understand how waste can be processed, in order to produce liquid fertilizer, which in turn can be used to support local communities to grow their own vegetable produce, and in this way address vulnerabilities related to the basic needs of food and nutrition amongst some of the most marginalised community members. Under Cities Race to Resilience, Lusaka has committed to various actions to build resilience in the city. Through the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoMSSA), the city has developed a Sustainable Energy Access and Climate Action Plan (SEACAP). This will guide the integration of resilience-building activities across urban planning, and ensure that all necessary activities related to adaptation and resilience-building are implemented, that funding is allocated for these activities, and that reporting takes place on these activities for the purposes of accountability.;Africa;Zambia;Lusaka;-15387526;28322817;Human Settlements Systems;Lusaka is addressing climate resilience through solid waste management (SWM), focusing on the challenges of a growing peri-urban population in informal settlements.

In 2020, production records were broken in Mexico, with 73% of production taking place in Jalisco. However, this has significant environmental and social impacts, such as deforestation and degradation of Jalisco’s temperate and tropical forests. To address this situation, the Jalisco State Government signed a Collaboration Agreement with the Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) to establish the basis for the formulation and implementation of an institutional cooperation scheme that would contribute to the sustainability of the sector. The initiative includes the design and implementation of the protocol and certification “Environmental Responsible Agave (ARA)” brand, the promotion of responsible production processes and the guarantee of forest conservation, with the aim of halting the deforestation of natural forests associated with tequila production by 2027. To accelerate this, technical roundtables were established to help innovate, develop technological solutions, and promote better production practices for the conservation of biodiversity and forest restoration – all with the aim of improving the environmental footprint. The goal: 50% reduction of deforestation by 2024, and 100% reduction by 2030. The initiative’s success depends largely on collaboration with industry. In addition, at the State level, inter-institutional collaboration with the ministries of economy and agriculture has been necessary to align and integrate economic and environmental policies to implement certification. Municipal authorities have also been involved in the dissemination of the brand and the training of technicians and producers. This initiative is framed into a State Strategy to stop deforestation by productive activities, that in addition to livestock and avocado production regulation (in development), the implementation of this protocol has raised the ambition to a 50% reduction of deforestation by 2024, and a 100% reduction by 2030.;North America;Mexico;Jalisco;20659699;-103349609;Food Security and Agriculture Systems;"In Jalisco, Mexico, the state government and the Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) are collaborating to address the environmental impacts of tequila production, particularly deforestation.

Together with financial institution, Climate Asset Management, a US$150 million finance package into a carbon program to restore trees and livelihoods across six African countries was announced with the objective to enhance the livelihoods of 1.5 million farming families and restore around 1.9 million hectares of degraded agricultural land across six countries – Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. “It demonstrates a new model for funding large-scale development initiatives, which puts the people directly impacted by climate change first, and in the process, creates more resilient landscapes,” said Chris Armitage, CEO, of Global EverGreening Alliance. The Global EverGreening Alliance partnered with Climate Asset Management to deliver financial support straight to the grassroots with communities receiving 45% of the carbon credits generated through the life of the programme. The Alliance has worked with its members to coordinate implementation across the six countries, ensuring a diverse range of expertise, experience and knowledge. Together with grassroots organisations, local communities are at the heart of the programme. “This programme is unique in that for the first time, smallholder farmers will be able to benefit from the sale of carbon credits directly released from the trees on their own farms,” said Geoffrey Kativa, Ag National Director, World Vision Kenya. With rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, increasing desertification and rapid biodiversity loss, climate change is severely impacting African ecosystems. Short-term solutions are only exacerbating the problem; threatening the productive capacity of African agriculture and the rural communities that depend on it for their livelihoods. The United Nations Environment Programme has estimated that more than a quarter of the African continent is in the process of becoming useless for cultivation due to degradation and that a further 319 million hectares of Africa are vulnerable to desertification. Evergreening practices transform landscapes by improving soil health, water availability and overall land productivity. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), in particular, is a proven and accessible model; protecting and managing naturally-regenerating trees and shrubs from roots and seeds that are already present in the soil has proven to be effective as a low-cost way to restore degraded land. Rich soil organic matter also enhances the landscapes’ ability to sequester, or capture, atmospheric carbon. Rehabilitating the land through Evergreening Agriculture can improve rural livelihoods while contributing to climate change mitigation. In collaboration with its members and grassroots organisations, the Alliance is directly contributing to the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution. The programme empowers farmers and communities to fine-tune, and self-invest in practices, and to participate more equitably in local value chains and markets. Stakeholders have access to cost-effective investments and carbon emissions offsetting options that also have significant social and environmental co-benefits. The Restore Africa Programme entered the implementation stage this year, after a very successful launch held in Kenya in May 2022, followed by the first phase of countries inception workshops held in Uganda, Malawi and Kenya.

Build Change;2022;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/reducing-climate-vulnerability-by-building-resilient-housing-in-honduras/;October 28, 2022;Reducing Climate Vulnerability by Building Resilient Housing in Honduras;Central America is at the frontline of climate change impacts, being one of the most vulnerable regions facing greater and more frequent extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical depressions and high temperatures. In November 2020, Hurricanes Eta and Iota, two powerful categories four and five hurricanes which landed in Honduras, left behind a humanitarian crisis which affected four million people, with 200 people dead and USD $15 million in losses. Recognizing the urgency for immediate support, Race to Resilience partner Build Change, which leads the Climate Resilient Housing Initiative, and the Honduran Red Cross, came together to develop an ambitious pilot for structural reinforcement and expansion of the houses affected by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in the Sula Valley of Honduras. The pilot started in the municipalities of Puerto Viejo and Choloma, both among the most vulnerable and affected communities. In 31 years I had never experienced something like this (…) we lost everything, we managed to save a very few things, the flood came – Irma Mercedes, a resident of Choloma. The pilot seeks to enhance climate adaptation and resilience, acknowledging the fact that every year extreme weather events like flooding are increasing in the municipality. The initiative consists of two main actions: Retrofit existing one-story homes, which entails strengthening the structure of the building. Expanding some of the homes to a second story, to create a safe refuge in case of emergency. Overall improvements and expansion will offer opportunities to enhance living conditions, earn income from rent or a home business, and increase home value. Solar panels and rainwater collection tanks will provide greater autonomy against power outages following severe storms and increasing periods of water scarcity. The project has been well received by the community, who has perceived the retrofitting and expansion process as an improvement to their existing living conditions with the additional benefit of enhancing their safety to be better prepared to respond to climate disasters. To date, Build Change has been able to reach 550 people through a combination of permanent housing solutions and transitional housing support and is scaling for further impact. The partnership with the Honduran Red Cross has allowed the project to work directly with the communities, responding to the needs voiced out by them in a culturally sensitive manner, and with their constant engagement in the implementation of the project.

Daraja;2022;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/early-warning-system-helps-locals-respond-to-extreme-weather-events-in-sudan/;October 11, 2022;Early Warning System Helps Locals Respond to Extreme Weather Events in Sudan;Tuti Island is located in Khartoum, Sudan. In 2020, the island was devastated by floods, which directly affected over 875,000 people, claimed approximately 120 lives, and generated flood-related damages and losses amounting to over USD $3.34 billion (WorldBank, 2020). The climate crisis and current projections of temperature rise, by 0.5°C to as much as 3°C by 2050, with more extreme temperatures in the north of Africa, will intensify and exacerbate the impacts of drought through increased evapotranspiration and reduced soil moisture, greatly affecting people’s livelihoods in the island. “We love the Nile, and it loves us back so much that sometimes it hugs us tight!” – Tuti Resident “We love the Nile, and it loves us back so much that sometimes it hugs us tight!” – Tuti Resident Mindful of this reality and aiming to lessen the impacts of the climate crisis by increasing people’s resilience, our partner DARAJA through SUDTT started the implementation of an innovative initiative, which seeks to provide the local community with timely forecast information and early warning system services for urban areas, in an inclusive manner. The DARAJA platform and application builds and supports a community network of users in accessing information and taking early action. Similar initiatives are also being piloted in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, aiming to improve the climate resilience of vulnerable populations living in informal settlements. In Tuti Island, in particular, SUDTT is working with the local community to strengthen the Taya system. The Taya system is a community-led indigenous flood monitoring and early warning system, which includes the participation of women and youth as key stakeholders, consisting of a system of tents built in the proximity of informal settlements highly vulnerable to flooding. The name originated from the Arabic word TAJ which means crown and is metaphorically used to indicate a high place in the ground to observe. It is a network of tents that operate as lookout points situated in strategic locations. The TAYA project is comprised of five steps: Vulnerability and needs assessments. Access to weather forecasts and warnings. Preference of ways to receive. warning information. Understanding the weather forecast. Use and apply the received forecast information and warning signals. At a later stage, the DARAJA partners aim to expand the project nationwide.;Africa;Sudan;Tuti Island, Khartoum;15616667;32533333;"Human Settlements Systems; Infrastructure Systems";In Tuti Island, Khartoum, Sudan, the DARAJA initiative, in collaboration with SUDTT and other partners, has implemented an innovative early warning system to enhance residents' resilience against extreme weather events.

Global Mangrove Alliance;2022;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/building-community-resilience-with-green-gray-infrastructure-in-concepcion-philippines/;October 3, 2022;Building Community Resilience with Green Gray Infrastructure in Concepcion, Philippines;"The Municipality of Concepcion is located in the northern part of Panay Island, the sixth-largest and fourth-most populous island in the Philippines, formed by more than 25 island villages. This coastal area is exposed to the effects of climate change, from more intense dry seasons to extreme storms and typhoons, affecting the livelihoods of local communities. In 2013, Hurricane Yolanda hit the islands devastating its population. According to Lorene Gabayeron, a community leader from Bagongon Concepcion “when the typhoon struck our community was not prepared, in an instant we lost our livelihoods, our property was destroyed.” Our partner Global Mangrove Alliance is working with Conservation International to use nature-based solutions along grey infrastructure to increase the resilience of 11 island villages. In Bagongon island, the Green Gray Infrastructure initiative has focused on three key objectives: Rebuild coastal sediment by replanting mangroves; Halt the ongoing beach erosion, and; Reduce the effects of extreme weather events on residents living in the Bagongon cove. The project uses a combination of wave attenuation fences, sediment trapping fences, low-crest semi-permeable breakwater as grey solutions, and mangrove restoration and the establishment of a community-based Marine Protected Area (MPA) as green solutions. So far, a total of 110,363 seedlings of native species have been planted covering an area of 11 hectares of mangrove rehabilitation and establishing a 769.7-hectare community-based marine protected area (CB-MPA), which included capacity building and training. The community has been directly engaged in the restoration and implementation of the project. As part of the effort to incentivize community participation, two livelihood projects were included: the production of coconut-based products and the production of virgin coconut oil (VCO) as liniment and ointment. This supports the community which is heavily reliant on fishing to diversify their income, and increasing resilience during typhoons, monsoons and other extreme weather events that affect fishing. The project also supported the community in establishing a Barangay Emergency Response Center and emergency response plans.“We did not have an appropriate system [Emergency Response Plan] like this before, as we were not actively engaged as a community, but we were able to achieve this now through the participation of our members and community (…) Now we believe we are more prepared to face the challenges of Climate change,” Vivian Amasan, Community Leader Bagongon Fisherfolks Association.";Asia;Philippines;Concepcion;112172;1230908;"Ocean and Coastal Systems; Infrastructure Systems";In Concepcion, Philippines, the Green Gray Infrastructure initiative led by Global Mangrove Alliance and Conservation International is enhancing community resilience against climate change.

Based on the latest scientific reports that discuss interconnected and multi-dimensional risk, we believe that while some economic sectors might have a more direct risk reduction benefit than others from investing in coastal resilience, all private sector actors can mitigate certain types of risk they are now facing, or will be facing in the near future. Coastal Resilience as part of risk mitigation. The 2022 IPCC peport states that worldwide climate resilient development action, based in part on safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems, is more urgent than previously assessed. According to the IPCC, climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make inclusive development choices that prioritize risk reduction, equity and justice. And when decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes. With a tenth of the world’s population and physical assets either living in or located at less than 10 meters above sea level, coastal cities and their economic assets are disproportionately affected by sea-level rise, and other climate-compounding climate- and ocean-driven impacts. Against this backdrop of predicted impacts from sea-level rise, the future viability of entire sectors of the ocean economy are at risk from climate change, as ecosystems are degraded, coastal infrastructure faces increasing risks, and the safety of operations at sea deteriorates. At the same time, as commercial uses of the ocean accelerate and climate change impacts worsen, marine ecosystems and the communities who depend on them face an unprecedented expansion in the extent, intensity, and diversity of these stressors, leading to cumulative pressures and the emergence of new interconnected biophysical, social, geopolitical and financial risks. During the high tide the inhabitants of Ghoramara Island are fixing the fragile soil embankment to restrain the further land erosion and the high tide that inundates to the island that is rapidly disappearing due to the sea level rise. Investing in coastal resilience. Nature-related risks matter to businesses due to impacts on markets, operations, supply chains, and customer base. Beyond the motivation for biosphere stewardship generally, and ocean stewardship specifically, the economic rationale for investing in coastal ecosystems is strong. When restored and protected, coastal habitats are important natural buffers to sea-level rise and storm surges, playing an essential role in ensuring the resilience of coastal communities, and reducing coastal risks, around the world. A business-as-usual trajectory entails great risk to our economies, with a cost potentially reaching up to US$8.4 trillion over the next 15 years. In the next 15 years damage is projected to increase to coastal real estate, ports, shipping, marine renewable energy and seafood as a result of climate change Up to US$3.98 trillion is at risk to coastal infrastructure and almost US$3 trillion to global fisheries if no action is taken. However, healthy coral reefs, as part of a coastal resilience strategy, can reduce the annual expected damages from storms to human life and property by more than $4 billion. Similarly, mangroves can prevent more than $65 billion in property damages and reduce flood risk to some 15 million people every year. According to the Global Commission on Adaptation, protecting and restoring mangroves globally, at a cost of less than $100 billion, could create $1 trillion in net benefits by 2030. Risk reduction. To better manage environmental risks, asset owners and managers need to recognize the level of financial risk in ocean related investments, integrate nature risk into mainstream risk assessments, seek and pilot risk-based and science-led approaches to guide actions toward sustainable pathways, engage companies on their vulnerabilities to such risk and encourage transparency and public reporting so that nature risks can be better managed. Investment in public goods—grey or green infrastructure, water quality, or biodiversity, among many others—is typically limited to governments because amounts invested cannot be recovered through access fees charged to beneficiaries. Coastal resilience is a public good, and investments in the large-scale restoration and sustainable management of natural assets for coastal protection has not been done by private entities due to lack of sufficient incentives. However, thanks to better communication of the benefits the ocean and coasts provide to people and increasing recognition among private economic actors as environmental stewards, this trend is poised to change. We are just now starting to see the first marketable products that use natural infrastructure for coastal resilience emerge and can be invested in. In the Anthropocene, complex systems, such as those involving the ocean ecosystems, economy, and coastal populations collectively face an interlinked and diverse set of risks including operational, social, financial, and reputational risks., Due to the complex nature of these risks, the private sector has not only an economic, but a financial stake in investing in coastal resilience, regardless of industry. Also, more recently there have been growing action for financial disclosure on climate related risks making this a business imperative. A resident slowly makes his way through the inundated streets of the village due to rising sea levels. Sayung subdistrict, Demak, Central Java, Indonesia. Three avenues to invest: Private, Public-Private, Insurance. There are a growing number of frameworks and tools to help identify, develop, and scale sustainable opportunities that build coastal resilience. These opportunities can be employed in three investment avenues, depending on a multitude of factors including scale, investment potential, and potential or projected financial returns.The private sector. The private sector can directly invest where they have a specific risk to address such as risk to a coastally located business interest or asset. New investment opportunities are emerging including concessional financing and blended finance opportunities that enable investors to invest into projects. When partnering on coastal resilience projects, financial institutions could adjust cost of capital available for the private sector by adjusting premiums depending on whether the proposed investment includes nature-based solutions and how this increases resilience. The emerging blue carbon market—which businesses are now looking at to offset some of their emissions—is also opportunity to attract finance for the restoration and protection of coastal marine ecosystems.Public-Private Partnerships. To invest in coastal resilience and infrastructure, the private sector in some cases needs to partner with landowners along the coastlines where resilience investments are needed at large scales. There are several ways to form these alliances including through public-private partnerships but these approaches employ cost- and benefit-sharing mechanisms for the partnership to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved. Insurance. If the insurance industry understands and properly values the risk reduction from natural coastal infrastructure investments, then it could reflect the economic benefits of reduced risks due to increased resilience. Within the context of insurance, capturing the value of natural infrastructure and the services it provides can happen in at least three ways., First, an investment, perhaps by a financial institution, could finance the construction of natural infrastructure which could then result in lower insurance premiums. Second, financial institutions could require investees or borrowers to take out nature-based insurance. Third, a relatively new approach, parametric insurance can be used to accelerate the payouts following a coastal storm or other event that leads to damages. Parametric insurance is a type of cover that pays out a pre-agreed amount to a policyholder according to pre-defined event characteristics or parameters, for example, peak storm wind speed for a given area. Examples in action. Investment to enhance resilience can be directed towards natural infrastructure directly, into the development of novel insurance products that incorporate the value of resilience investments, or into companies that specialize in building resilience or measuring the direct impact of resilience investments. Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance. ORRAA pioneers innovative finance products that drive investment in marine and coastal natural capital, reduce ocean and climate risks, and build resilience in coastal communities. The private sector can help ORRAA build risk-adjusted, innovative and scalable products that change the risk perceptions of investing in coastal natural capital and increase resilience while delivering a return on investment. Global Fund for Coral Reefs. The GFCR is a 10-year, $625 million blended finance vehicle established through a coalition between United Nations agencies, financial institutions, and private philanthropy sources. The GFCR supports business models that can sustainably finance key conservation and development goals for coral reefs via two initiative windows. Technical assistance, capacity development, monitoring, and evaluation are provided via the grant window, while the investment window generates de-risked investment capital to maximize the impact of projects incubated by the grant window. Blue Carbon Buyers Alliance. The currently forming BCBA will serve as the “buyers voice” in the growing blue carbon community of practice in order to help scale blue carbon markets to conserve and restore coastal ecosystems. The private sector can commit to purchase high quality blue carbon credits to send a strong demand signal in a nascent market. Blue Natural Capital Financing Facility. The BNCFF supports the development of sound, investable Blue Natural Capital (BNC) projects with clear ecosystem service benefits, based on multiple income streams and appropriate risk-return profiles. Through the BNCFF, private investment can result in actual impact on the ground. Development of Insurance Products. AXA Climate’s focus on novel insurance products build on risk valuation to combine resilience and adaptation investments and insurance. Through collaborations around developing new insurance schemes for coastal communities, investment can indirectly reduce costs associated with hazards or hazard risk by adjusting insurance premiums or providing capital to rebuild after a disaster. Companies Building Coastal Resilience. Using Wood’s ResilienceLensTM can unlock the resilience dividend as a return on investment in coastal resilience projects. The tool is an interactive web-based screening tool to measure the resilience value of projects, identify requirements and outputs that projects need to incorporate to adapt to shocks and stresses, deliver reliable performance, generate co-benefits to communities, and accelerate implementation of projects to build back better. Project financiers and investment institutions, as well as city leaders, whose primary interest is the identification of viable and bankable projects to enhance urban resilience, can also leverage and apply the ResilienceLensTM screen to their project portfolios.";Africa;Tanzania;Dar es Salaam;-6792354;39208328;Food Security and Agriculture Systems;ORRAA, in collaboration with AFO and supported by the Government of Canada and the UK’s Blue Planet Fund, is advancing coastal resilience in Dar-es-Salaam by restoring mangrove forests and establishing a voluntary carbon market.
