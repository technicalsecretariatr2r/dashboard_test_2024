2023 RtR Progress Report;Progress Report;The 2023 Race to Resilience report highlights progress toward building climate resilience for 3.17 billion people by 2030. With 647 members across 164 countries mobilizing substantial resources, the campaign advances global adaptation efforts across diverse sectors, guided by the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda.;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Race-to-Resilience-2023-Campaign-Progress-Report.pdf;rtr_progress_report_2023
2022 RtR Progress Report;Progress Report;This 2022 report highlights progress in the UN’s Race to Zero and Race to Resilience campaigns, uniting over 13,000 non-state actors in the push for a zero-carbon, resilient world. It reviews achievements and challenges as cities, businesses, and institutions work to meet the 1.5°C goal, protect vulnerable communities, and build a sustainable future ahead of COP27.;https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Race-to-Zero-Race-to-Resilience-Progress-Report.pdf;rtr_progress_report_2022

Resilience Attributes;Technical Documentation;Resilience Attributes are critical qualities enabling systems to withstand, adapt, and recover from adverse conditions. The identification and definition of these attributes and corresponding sub-categories were the result of an exhaustive collaborative process involving a literature review and expert consultations including the Race to Resilience's Methodological Advisory Group and stakeholders from the Resilience Knowledge Coalition. They serve as a predictive measure of resilience, aiding in the design, supervision, and initial assessment of resilient action. In this sense, interventions that positively impact these attributes are seen to improve the capacity of climate-vulnerable beneficiaries to respond to and adapt to changes. Within the context of the RtR's Metrics Framework, Resilience Attributes constitute the depth metrics, representing the qualitative dimension of the index that measures the increased resilience resulting from our partner's efforts.;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M_1xSqTGVwwn4jfiV4Cg9EFSccys1MBR/view;rtr_resilience_attributes_foto
Resilience Action Clusters;Technical Documentation;Resilience Action Clusters serve to identify and categorise actions focused on building climate resilience. These emerged from a collaboration between different actors, originating in the collection of resilience actions from the Marrakech Partnership (Global Climate Action, 2021), the consulting firm Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP, 2022), and the IPCC Action List (IPCC, 2021). These actions were classified into 29 categories, the “Resilience Action Clusters”, which were validated by the campaign's Methodology Advisory Group (MAG). Resilience actions clusters usually include a combination of adaptation and response measures, as well as capacity building and awareness raising actions. Partners are asked to specify which action clusters align with their actions on the first step of the reporting tool: The General Information Survey.;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ScMwMjT3lusiB0c8tYYlb_dpki4YgOpk/view;rtr_resilience_action_clusters
Practical Guide to the Application of the RtR Metrics Framework (ARUP & RTR);Technical Documentation;The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance to non-State actors seeking to measure their impact on the resilience of people to climate change. The scenarios explored go into detail on how organisations can, or could, link into the Race to Resilience framework.;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VI7DhPcrHzYiidAVd4iu0IpNQYom4fks/view?usp=sharing;rtr_arup_manual_foto
RtR Metrics Framework;Framework;The fundamental aim of the Metrics Framework is to provide a method to record, monitor, and evaluate the growth of resilience, enabling learning from these processes.;https://race.cr2.cl/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RtR-Metrics-Framework-2023.pdf;metric_framework_foto
A pioneering approach to measure increased resilience to face climate change: insights from the Race to Resilience campaign;Scientific Article;"This paper illustrates a methodology to measure the impact of resilience-building actions on the increased resilience of people and natural systems to face climate change, developed and field-tested around the Race to Resilience Campaign. Despite increasing acknowledgment of the need for robust methodologies and indicators to monitor and evaluate efforts across adaptation planning and implementation, and provide credibility, accountability and transparency to such actions, there is still a lack of sufficiently standardized and agreed upon metrics able to capture the effect of resilience-building actions. The proposal illustrated in this manuscript offers a pioneering approach for high-level tracking, monitoring and evaluation of resilience-building efforts of non-state actors, based on two complementing sets of metrics: depth metrics measure the degree to which an action is generating a change to fundamental conditions which can demonstrably be related to increasing resilience; while magnitude metrics offer a quantification of the beneficiaries that are affected by these changes. Underlying both stand the Resilience Attributes: properties which can be soundly associated with triggering resilience across different systems, and which can then be used to assess increased resilience 'by proxy': that is, by seeing how an action sets forth changes in properties commonly associated with resilience. These Attributes were identified based on updated scientific literature and co-construction exercises with global experts. The integration of Depth and Magnitude indices, adjusted by a Confidence Index evaluating data reliability, allows to estimate the overall contribution of a set of actions on increasing resilience against climate challenges. Based on the above, a possible Monitoring & Evaluation cycle is proposed, and an illustration is offered on two case studies from the Race to Resilience campaign. Key strengths, lessons learned and insights are summarized to stimulate the global discussion, in the context of the Global Stocktake and Global Goal on Adaptation.";https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ad6d37;rtr_paper01_foto
