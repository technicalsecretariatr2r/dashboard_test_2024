Metzger,,,,,,,,abby@globalforestgen.org,,"Acción Andina is a large-scale, community-led reforestation and ecosystem restoration initiative focused on the protection and regeneration of the Andes Mountain forests. Our primary goal is to restore one million hectares of native forest in the Andes through the leadership of Indigenous and local communities. By blending traditional knowledge with modern conservation techniques, we aim to strengthen ecological resilience to climate change, preserve biodiversity, and safeguard critical water sources for local populations. Through sustainable restoration and land stewardship practices, we support local capacity-building and foster long-term ecosystem health, improving resilience across both human and environmental systems.    Addition:  Local and indigenous women in particular play an essential role in the reforestation events, where in places like Peru and Ecuador, people gather in the hundreds and plant tens of thousands of trees in a single day. In general, women oversee nursery operations where young trees grow before being planted. The women are employed throughout the year, as it takes many months in the high elevation of the Andes to grow the seedlings. Some communities in Ecuador have decided to accept payment in the form of materials that can be used to repair a roof or maintain water systems. Their jobs enable the women to make a meaningful contribution to their families’ financial security. ","At Acción Andina, resilience is defined as the capacity of ecosystems and communities to withstand, adapt to, and recover from environmental challenges, including climate change, while maintaining the ability to thrive in the long term. Climate resilience specifically refers to the ability of restored Andean forests and the local communities that depend on them to absorb the impacts of climate variability, such as extreme weather events, droughts, and shifts in water availability, without losing essential ecosystem services.    By restoring native forests, we aim to enhance ecological resilience through increased biodiversity, improved water regulation, and strengthened carbon sequestration. At the same time, we work closely with Indigenous and local communities to foster social resilience by preserving traditional knowledge, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and strengthening the capacity of these communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions.","www.globalforestgeneration.org, accion-andina.org",,Women and girls,,,,Indigenous and traditional communities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,South America,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We track progress through a combination of field data collection, remote sensing (e.g., drones), and on-the-ground reporting from our member organizations. This includes detailed metrics on forest coverage, species diversity, water source stability, and community involvement. Remote sensing imagery is used to assess reforestation progress, while community partners submit qualitative and quantitative reports on local ecosystem changes. Our data is aggregated to evaluate performance and refine restoration strategies across different regions.    Additionally, GFG launched a major upgrade to our data collection systems for Acción Andina. Our new platform, built on Amp Impact and a Salesforce Customer Relationship Management system, will streamline data collection, storage, and analysis. This cutting-edge system will allow our local partners to directly report on conservation implementation and progress, while featuring a dynamic dashboard to track long-term restoration and conservation goals. Finally, Global Forest Generation launched the ""Acción Andina Water Impact Monitoring Framework."" The project emphasizes a locally led, simple, and effective reporting system that will enhance partner capacity to monitor water availability and societal benefits. It will incorporate the expertise of Acción Andina’s partners who already have water monitoring systems in place. With better data, the initiative will improve decision-making by identifying threats and opportunities, while optimizing GFG’s investments in restoration and conservation activities.

Additionally, cattle grazing historically has and continues to compete with restoration activities. However, some of our projects are working with local cattle ranchers to help transition to sustainable practices. In Bolivia for example, cattle ranchers, international experts, and environmental organizations are uniting to develop an innovative model for ranching that focuses on enhancing productivity and profitability while preserving the natural grassland ecosystem of the Beni savanna.  ",,"Climate resilient, sustainable agriculture increases yields by 17% and reduces farm level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 21%, without expansion of the agricultural frontier.",,,"The initiative has an indirect impact on food and agriculture systems since most local communities' livelihoods depend on water sourced from the highland areas where Acción Andina conducts its activities. A clear example is their crops, which are crucial for subsistence and, at times, are also tied to their economic activities.",,,Directly related,"Water security is a central focus of Acción Andina's restoration and conservation work. In the Andes, glaciers and snowfall provide up to 35% of the annual river basin water supply in some of the driest areas of Peru and Chile. However, climate change has led to a 30-50% reduction in Andean glaciers over the past 30 years, threatening water security for the 90 million people who depend on their meltwater for agriculture, daily use, and industry (source: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/9/5/196). The high-Andean forests intercept moisture-rich clouds and store water in their dense foliage and roots, releasing it during the dry months and recharging rivers, including the Amazon. Protecting and restoring these remote, fragile, and endangered ecosystems is paramount to the water security of the entire continent. Additionally, we support Water and Nature Systems in the following ways:    -Development of water protected areas, such as the Otavalo Mojanda Water Protection Area in Ecuador that covers 1,836 hectares (4,538 acres) and includes 35 water sources supplying water to 14,330 people in Otavalo Canton in northern Ecuador.    -Installation or maintenance of wells, water catchment systems, efficient sprinklers and other infrastructure to improve water retention or reduce water waste.     -Support for capacity building and knowledge sharing around water.

By restoring native forests and protecting critical ecosystems, we help create more resilient environments where communities can thrive despite the challenges posed by climate change.    Our activities related to human settlement systems include:    Improved Livelihoods Through Ecosystem Services: The restoration of native forests improves ecosystem services, such as water regulation, soil fertility, and air quality, which are vital for agriculture and other local livelihoods. This helps stabilize the economy of rural communities, reducing the risk of displacement due to environmental degradation.    Strengthening Local Climate Adaptation: By restoring forests that buffer against extreme weather events (e.g., heavy rains, landslides, and droughts), we help protect settlements from climate-induced hazards. This reduces the vulnerability of homes and infrastructure, creating safer living conditions for families in high-altitude regions.    Capacity Building and Community Empowerment: We provide local communities with training and resources to manage their lands more sustainably. This fosters long-term resilience by equipping local populations with the knowledge and tools to maintain ecological balance and adapt to environmental changes, preventing forced migration or settlement abandonment due to declining natural resources.    Cultural and Social Resilience: Our work emphasizes the importance of preserving traditional knowledge and cultural connections to the land, which are integral to the identity and well-being of Indigenous communities.

It allows us to assess the impact of our 14 partners in the field and report results to donors and key allies. This process requires a standard system of data reporting, and the growth of Acción Andina since its establishment in 2018 has necessitated a more robust system to effectively support and enhance current monitoring practices.  During the fiscal year, GFG and Acción Andina lead implementing partner, Asociacion Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN), began work on a new system to improve stakeholder relationships and track and communicate restoration activities. The system will incorporate a Salesforce-based impact management platform that provides a central hub for conservation partners to report key metrics and restoration activities. The platform will feature a data dashboard to track long-term progress across the entire Acción Andina initiative, as well as a grant lifecycle tool to measure the impact of funds over time and reduce the burden of grant reporting.  While our implementing Acción Andina partners already collect detailed data on everything from number of trees planted, to number of nurseries, to number of local communities involved, the more streamlined and standardized system will enable to monitor and evaluate restoration and conservation progress in near real-time, allowing for better decision-making, more cost-effective programs, and improved transparency and accountability. The beneficiaries are donors who understand how their money is being implemented, policymakers who can see specific metrics we are achieving and how they support broader decision-making goals, our conservation partners who can better assess, refine, and adjust goals to meet targets, and GFG and Acción Andina leadership who can better link cost to impact and make adjustments to overall strategy.

ROOH’s vision is to initially create a campaign supported by the UN High Level Champions’ Race to Resilience (RtR) and Race to Zero Campaign and seeks to deliver locally driven, globally assisted resilience breakthrough to help achieve the RtR goal of assisting 4 billion people who are most vulnerable to build homes that are resilient to the disastrous impacts of climate change.  SDI Slum dwellers international of which SPARC NSDF and Mahila Milan are founder affiliates seeks to demonstrate a bottom-up solution that meet top down. This campaign seeks to advise to produce affordable, available and accessible material with designs and construction material and alternatives in financing and governance within the affordability of the informal inhabitants. This is being done through their central involvement of communities, especially women from Informal settlements.   93% of all Asian housing stock informally produced financed and design but communities themselves indicates the serious local of investments to mainstream this issue which extreme climate is producing devastating impacts on it. Last four decades of intense evidence building for greater financial technical and planning support for habitat and infrastructures for the informal communities has not produced a serious dent in the rising informality of habitat and the devastation of climate linked episodes.  Hence, the ROOH will demonstrate through 100 labs, which will participate in design development and demonstration of intensely local adaptation responses, the campaign will be accompanied by action on the ground. Through actual model exhibitions of what they develop, their ideas, techniques and problem-solving mechanisms can be demonstrated to a peer cross-learning community across 100 of these labs across different countries.  This adaptation response also acknowledges that informal inhabitations will have to accommodate another 1.5 billion climate refugees. Nee ideas, new alliances and new innovations are urgently needed, and ROOH represents one such intervention. Intensely local but linked and connected to the national and global.  Presently, 1 billion people live in informal settlements, in cities which are typically home to up to 50% of the urban residents in the Global South. This number is projected to double by 2050, with 90% of this increase projected in Asian and African towns and cities. This means that approximately 2 billion urban dwellers will require housing and basic services that are resilient to climate-change impacts. Many of these people today continue to live in poor quality habitats that are not only vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but fundamentally face evictions and lack secure tenure and access to basic infrastructure such as safe drinking water, safe sanitation systems with proper waste disposal, and other infrastructure and services which are essential for safe living.  Governments have not invested in infrastructure and housing improvement for those living informally. As this deficit gowns, the need outstrips the public resources needed to address the problem. The current structure of urban development planning follows 19th century colonial planning norms and is designed for the formal city and either ignores or punishes informality and those living in informal settlements.  For promoting systemic change to create an investment environment where all available resources and capabilities to produce resilient habitat need to be mobilized for equitable urban development makes ROOH an urgent priority in an already urbanized planet. While ROOH urges state institutions to address security of tenure and basic amenities ROOH seeks to support resilient housing driven by households themselves.  ROOH seeks to keep the women and their neighborhoods’ at the center of a process where NGOs, universities, providers of building materials and finance work with them and their cities to transform their homes to be resilient as soon and urgently as possible.  Networks of the poor that exist at city and national levels have mobilized organizational capacity and resources to learn, test and innovate solutions to  achieve this change. Change needs to draw attention to three generations or more of those who live informally in cities; to be developed means not just to survive but the thrive in resilient homes.   ROOH’s has many ambitious aspirations to develop this process so that as many networks, Organizations and communities who can appropriate this process and produce locally sustainable outcomes that fulfil as many resilience goals as possible. Instead of a top down, centrally defined strategy the polycentric approach seeks networks that share and learn together through coalition and cooperation of different actors.  ROOH envisages that these collaborations will spawn off several action circles that will coalesce to promote the systemic changes in ROOH’s priority areas.  This campaign has begun with a one-year finance provided to GRP by USAID as a seeding period. During this year engagements with various communities, social movements, city managers, sector experts will form a core team of anchors who will seek solutions by identifying low carbon materials, designs & construction systems and finance on the one hand and dialogue with city and government to address infrastructure and tenure security on the other. Catalyzing participatory forms of resilient designs, governance improvement and mobilizing finance for such participatory action where local communities participate, lead and innovate together with other actors therefore forms the core principle of ROOH.  These innovations will be tested through pilots in all climate zones and geographies for the three  elements that make housing vulnerable: Heat, Water and Wind.  The aim to delivering ROOH will need an “unusual” coalition of partners. From slum dwellers to financiers, designers, architects, suppliers, cement and concrete industry, paint manufacturers, city mayors and others who want to make a difference to the lives of the one billion people living in all locations, informal settlements and many more in poor quality housing.  Also linked to this is how do we help early warning systems link to what communities and neighborhoods’ can do realistically as first responders to impending climate events and create a constructive pathway for immediate assistance and long-term resilient habitat. In the event of a climate disaster impacting neighborhoods’ what are the protocols that must be in place to assist communities immediately and plan with good quality evidence and data what the relief can do to lead to long term resilience.  Finally, with the next COP focusing on losses and  damages how can this process assist communities, and their networks develop legitimacy and compensate the communities for the losses and damages they incur due to climate change.  Most valuable ideas and strategies developed in one place must be readily available to other locations and with full acknowledgement that they will be adapted, adopted, reformulated and celebrated as multidimensional and true adaptation for what works locally.    There are 5 phases of the campaign which targets to achieve resilience in the communities through new construction of the houses or by exploring retrofitting options:    Phase 1: Settlement Profiling Listening to Communities and Data collection    Phase 2: Design & Optimal Solutions  Exploration of Design and building Materials    Phase 3: Demo Projects - house and habitat workshops of options sampled  Demonstration of actual techniques materials and financing     Phase 4: Implementation – Dwellers willing to explore this strategy and support Scaling up locally and sharing globally to see what works, what impediments    Phase 5: Dissemination & tracking the ongoing process Produce local models and global applications, building policy governance, construction systems, measurements safety standards  ","Under the ROOH campaign, we have developed collaboratives known as ""Labs"" where professionals, community leaders, and experts work together to understand and address challenges faced by people living in informal settlements, particularly focusing on finding low-carbon emission, affordable, and accessible housing solutions. These labs aim to develop community-driven, resilient housing solutions that consider both local techniques and innovative materials.    The name ""labs"" is selected from the idea experimentation, exploration, and learning. In this case, the learning labs serve as a metaphorical laboratory where different stakeholders experiment with ideas, techniques, and materials to find sustainable and feasible housing solutions for informal settlements. The labs produce resilient housing constructions that can endure environmental difficulties while staying culturally and economically relevant by integrating local skills with professional competence.    The campaign seeks to identify alternatives that meet specific criteria. These alternatives must take into account the unique challenges posed by different microclimatic zones and settlement contexts. Learning labs provide the platform for professionals and community leaders to collaborate, understand local challenges, study coping mechanisms, and explore innovative options.

With its focus on climate action since 2021, the partnership plays a key role in coordinating water-sanitation-hygiene (WASH) efforts for connecting SDGs 6 and 13, while recognizing that the ability to meet these SDGs directly affects and is affected by almost all of the other SDGs, including poverty, food, gender and inequality.   As the partnership is increasing its focus at country level, SWA contributes to the success of the Paris Agreement by providing partners with a solid background on why and how countries can integrate climate action and WASH.   SWA’s Mutual Accountability Mechanism (MAM) provides a mechanism to partners to make smart commitments based on both climate and WASH national plans, and facilitate reaching consensus on specific actions each actor will take to achieve their short- to medium-term targets on the road to reaching the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.   While new and innovative climate financing approaches have recently come into play, the water and sanitation sector is lagging behind in tapping into it. SWA is coordinating efforts to address the current lack of understanding on the adaptation needs for basic services on the part of climate stakeholders, as well as bringing to the attention of water and sanitation stakeholders how climate financing schemes work and to make a strong climate rationale for water and sanitation.  Based on all this, focus areas of SWA´s work on climate include:  •	High level global advocacy and country coordination to ensure that WASH adaptation needs, and mitigation potential are recognized in climate financing strategies, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPs), leading to practical implementation efforts.   •	High level global advocacy and national efforts to ensure that climate risks are well understood and integrated at policy and implementation levels by the WASH community.

These data are collected on an annual or bi-annual basis (depending on data availability) through tools such as the JMP and GLAAS initiatives and do not demonstrate SWA’s contribution directly. The SWA Secretariat is responsible for compiling and analysing these indicators. Intermediate outcome benchmark indicators (country level): The Results Framework links partnership activities to long-term national and sector results. This is done through ‘country self-assessments’, where partners periodically complete a self-assessment for their country which considers their sector’s progress according to SWA’s Strategic Objectives. This multi-stakeholder assessment results in a score for each objective. The evolution of these scores over time, for each SWA partner country, will allow SWA to follow changes happening at the national level and to better understand its own contribution to change. The SWA Secretariat uses the Results Framework country self-assessments to tailor support to countries’ specific needs. This information is then triangulated with existing data sources such as GLAAS, OECD or the United Nations Universal Periodic Review. SWA activities and output indicators: Outputs are mainly quantitative indicators which assess the secretariat and partnership’s activities and performance - for example, the High-Level Meetings, the support we provide to our partners, or the work groups we facilitate. We assess these results through data that we collect (Activity Monitoring System), such as the level of satisfaction of participants to our activities or the number and type of public commitments that our partners make through the SWA Mutual Accountability Mechanism (MAM).",,"In terms of data collected from our country partners, we only receive it at the intermediate outcome benchmark indicators level through Country Self-Assessments (CSA). In addition to the data validation process explained below, SWA’s Secretariat is involved in every step ensuring that the assessment is done correctly, and that the data provided is supported by evidence. As mentioned above, partners provide their information, and we have a three-step analysis: The first analysis is made regarding the completion of the self-assessment and the quality of the answers provided.

Priority is that WASH systems for those currently lacking access are planned, built, and operated with attention to resilience in the face of a changing climate (while maximizing opportunities for mitigation).    •	Ensuring that existing WASH systems in areas highly exposed to climate risks are retrofitted and upgraded. Existing WASH systems in locations highly exposed to climate risks are retrofitted and upgraded through the explicit consideration and internalization of the risks and opportunities that alternative climate change scenarios are likely to imply for their operation and maintenance.   •	Fostering water conservation, efficiency and reuse throughout existing WASH systems.

Box 51182,,Eugene,,,United States,,,Bob Doppelt,,,,,,,,bob@trig-cli.org,,"The International Transformational Resilience Coalition (ITRC) will assist neighborhoods and communities worldwide in building population-level mental wellness and (what we call) transformational resilience to prevent and heal the mental health and psychosocial problems generated by the global climate-ecosystem-biodiversity (C-E-B) crisis. We will accomplish this by working with partners and co-sponsors in different regions and nations to help local leaders learn how to use a public health approach to mental wellness and resilience to asengage all adults, adolescents, and young children in activities that strengthen their capacity to remain socially, psychologically, emotionally, and behaviorally healthy and resilient in the midst of pervasive stresses, emergencies, and disasters generated by the C-E-B crisis.","We focus on the social, psychological, emotional, and behavioral aspects of resilience and use the term ""Transformational Resilience.""  TR involves far more that ""bouncing back"" from shocks and persistent adversities, which is what many people think resilience means. This definition assumes hardships will end and give people time to return to previous conditions. It also assumes that conditions will be similar after a major adversity to what they were beforehand, and that people want to return to them.      Bouncing back to pervious conditions, however, will increasingly not be possible--or even desirable--as the C-E-B crisis intensifies. One reason is that circumstances will continually change, often in harmful ways, and make it impossible to return to previous conditions. In addition, the mixture of accumulating disruptions to the systems people rely on for basic needs, and more frequent, extreme, and prolonged disasters and emergencies, will leave people with less and less, or no time at all, to recover and return to previous conditions.      In addition, marginalized and impoverished populations and communities, those who experience ongoing racism, sexism, and other systemic oppressions, and people who have been subjected to other forms of traumatic stresses or traumas don't want to return to previous conditions. They want to increase their sense of health, safety, and wellbeing substantially above pre-adversity levels.     Further, in many cases, previous ways of living, including resource extraction, production, consumption, and waste methods, the types and amount of energy used, and ways that people separate themselves from others, contributed to the C-E-B crisis, so bouncing back to pre-crisis conditions will often make the crisis worse.  	  The suffering generated by the C-E-B crisis can either defeat or empower us. It can empower us if we are able to use adversities to learn, grow, and find constructive new sources of meaning,  purpose, and direction.     Rather than bouncing back to previous—and often unhealthy conditions--enhancing resilience during the C-E-B crisis should focus on what we call Transformational Resilience. This is the ability of individuals, families, organizations, and entire communities to use adversities as catalysts to transform their thinking and behaviors, and the way their community functions, to create conditions that are substantially more healthy, safe, connected, supported, just, equitable, and ecologically regenerative than previously existed.     In psychology this process is often called ""post-traumatic growth,"" ""trauma-induced growth,"" or ""adversity-based growth.""  However, when applied to the C-E-B crisis, we believe Transformational Resilience is a much more helpful term. That’s because it speaks to the fundamental changes in thinking and practices needed to prevent and heal not only individual mental health and psychosocial struggles, but to also transform groups organizations, and communities into socially, economically, and ecologically regenerative systems.

Resilience underpins sustainable development in an increasingly unpredictable world. We envisage an inclusive world in harmony with nature, that is better prepared to cope with shocks, adapt to change, and transform – all within planetary boundaries.    GRP is an inclusive and collaborative partnership that seeks to create a global movement for resilience that raises the profile and catalyses actions for resilience. GRP is currently comprised of more than 60 organisations, which bring together a broad range of skills, capacities and perspectives and provide powerful collaboration opportunities. Organisations who share GRP’s vision, strategic focus, approach, and values are welcome to apply to become a Partner. In doing so, they also make certain commitments to strengthen the Partnership.    Partnership Approach  GRP delivers a suite of strategic interventions through three work areas that set out to add value to the work of our individual Partners and ensures that together we are stronger than the sum of our parts.    Innovation: We provide resilience incubation and acceleration support to GRP partners and coalition members. We contribute to the design of best practice resilience building initiatives by facilitating training and leadership development. We coordinate work with specific knowledge partners for ideation and investment processes, networks of stakeholders relevant for scaling up, such as social entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, impact investors, foundations and business schools, from both the South and North.  Knowledge: We advance the collective knowledge about resilience through iterative and collaborative knowledge co-production processes. As part of this, we seek to develop capacity, build networks, foster social capital, and implement actions that contribute to ongoing learning among partners and beyond.  Policy: We raise investment and policy ambitions on resilience. We focus on bridging the voices and experiences of local actors to the regional and global policy spaces to ensure they inform the global policy discourse. Beyond creating greater visibility of the importance of local voices, GRP’s policy work aims to progressively increase the influencing potential of these lesser heard and underrepresented voices on global resilience action in response to heightening impacts.  Across our areas of work, we seek to support, connect and catalyse initiatives amongst Partners that deliver resilience impacts.    Examples:    Innovative Finance for Resilience  Objective: Identify, co-design, and invest in early stage innovations that build resilience at the intersection of peace & stability, disaster resilience, and food & water security in vulnerable and fragile regions.    South to South Resilience Academies  Objective: Mobilize transdisciplinary teams of academics, thought leaders and practitioners from the Global South, to work together towards solving the most difficult resilience challenges.    Voices from the Frontline  Objective: Collect stories and amplify the role that grassroots organisations are playing in building resilience    Partnership Commitment  Becoming a GRP Partner requires a commitment from the organisation to be an active member and to:    Help set GRP’s objectives and strategy, and remain engaged on its progress    Share and agree with the GRP vision and values  Undertake work on resilience policies, programmes, investments and innovations  Commit to work together on initiatives around GRP’s areas of work  Participate and contribute to GRP meetings, events and/or products   Support GRP by being an engaged partner which could include sharing information on resilience and/or provision of resources  GRP Values  Over and above the Partnership Commitment, Partners are expected to share and promote the following fundamental values:    Internationally proclaimed human rights  Social sustainability and ethical behavior  Gender and other forms of equality  Environmental responsibility  Fight corruption and promote transparency  The Partnership is not open to individuals or informal groups either.    Governance Structure  The Partnership consists of three bodies:    GRP Partners – Organisations active in resilience, who share GRP’s vision and values, and have formally joined the Partnership.  Advisory Council – Members who advise the implementation of GRP’s strategy and plans.  GRP Secretariat – A small team that convenes and catalyses actions by the Partners and implements specific activities on behalf of the Partnership. The Secretariat is hosted at the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) at Stockholm University.  Partnership Decision  The ultimate decision for participation in GRP lies with the GRP Advisory Council who is responsible for applying these guidelines. The Advisory Council will apply discretion based on its knowledge of the applicants and their social, ethical, and environmental practices. In exceptional circumstances, the Advisory Council may ask for additional information before making a final decision. We emphasise that the Partnership cannot endorse Partners or any of their practices.    The success of the Partnership is dependent on Partners working together. To do this, Partners are expected to work on specific actions under GRP’s three interlinked areas of work: Innovation, Knowledge, and Policy. This could include working on initiatives with GRP Partners. In addition, all Partners will be invited to an annual Partners’ meeting. This is an opportunity to share and develop actions on resilience, review GRP’s strategy and plans, and elect members to the GRP Advisory Council. Organisations who are not Partners but are interested in resilience are able to attend the annual meeting as observers.    Application Process  To become a GRP Partner, please fill in the GRP Expression of Interest Form (https://enketo.resilienceplatform.info/x/hBvGKHCK). If you have any questions, contact the GRP Secretariat at (info@globalresiliencepartnership.org).    The Secretariat will prepare the application for review by the Advisory Council. If satisfactory, the Advisory Council will then extend a formal invitation to interested parties. There is no defined time limit to being a Partner. Should a member want to terminate its membership as a Partner an email should be sent to the Secretariat at the address above. Partners do not receive remuneration by GRP for their work, and generally cover their own costs although some support may be available for Partners from the South to attend the meetings.

The goal of the Global Mangrove Alliance is to increase the global area of mangrove habitat through conservation, restoration and equitable management. To meet our goal, our Alliance utilizes the collective expertise of our members to connect and coordinate diverse initiatives into a global portfolio that leverages and amplifies best practices and pursues conservation and restoration opportunities. We concentrate our strengths of on the ground presence and coordination on three main areas of focus:    1. Halting Mangrove Loss  Despite a declining loss rate globally, significant threats remain in key geographies. Loss and degradation are primarily linked to human activities but are compounded by the effects of climate change. Focusing on national and sub-national threats to mangroves within these locations is a priority.    2. Implementing science-based restoration  Large-scale restoration with local engagement and participation needs a basis in sound science. The global mangrove community must compile recommendations on best practices of mangrove restoration, lower restoration costs, and take efforts to scale to achieve our goals.    3. Building Awareness  The biggest strength of the Global Mangrove Alliance is the breadth and depth of its network. Sharing experience and information within the Alliance and through our network will remove barriers and create synergies as we work towards our goals.    Together,  the Alliance endeavors to achieve global priorities and actions by providing a foundation for members to work together, utilizing the collective expertise of our members to connect and coordinate diverse initiatives into a global portfolio that leverages and amplifies best practices and pursues conservation and restoration opportunities.    Our collaborative approach increases our ability to leverage funding; promote scientific research; strengthen coastal management and governance,  education, disaster risk reduction, climate mitigation and adaptation related plans and policies; and accelerate the conservation and restoration of mangroves at a scale. The GMA firmly believes that through collaboration we can achieve more and go beyond the capacity of any individual organization.

Anticipatory Action is designed to reduce the humanitarian impacts of a forecast hazard and is implemented before the most acute impacts of an event are felt. When a pre-defined trigger threshold for drought impact is forecasted, the RAAWG works closely with local government and stakeholders to implement Anticipatory Actions such as early warning messages, cash transfers, the provision of drought-resistant seeds, agricultural training, and improving water sources. RAAWG partners closely with the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) on this front. SADC formally endorsed anticipatory action programming through the adoption of the SADC Maputo Declaration on Bridging the Gap between Early Warning and Early Action in 2022.    The Regional Anticipatory Action Working Group (RAAWG) plays a pivotal role in advancing the Race to Resilience's vision and goal of enhancing the resilience of four billion people in vulnerable communities. By fostering coordination and strengthening joint actions, the working group embodies a collaborative approach essential for addressing the multifaceted climate risks faced by urban, rural, and coastal communities. This group's efforts align with the Race to Resilience's mission by leveraging the collective expertise and resources of various non-state actors (NSAs), including businesses, cities, regions, the finance sector, civil society organizations (CSOs), and local communities.    Through its convening power, the working group enhances the ambition loop, driving resilience breakthroughs by promoting innovative anticipatory action strategies that preemptively address climate-related disasters. This proactive stance not only mitigates the impacts of such events but also supports system transformations that elevate community resilience. Moreover, the group's focus on mobilizing and increasing financial flows for resilience initiatives ensures that the necessary resources are directed towards the most vulnerable populations, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of these interventions.","In the context of your regional anticipatory action working group, ""resilience"" can be defined as the ability of vulnerable communities to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related shocks and stresses. This includes the capacity to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining or quickly restoring essential functions and structures.    ""Climate resilience,"" specifically, refers to the capacity of these communities to absorb the impacts of climate-related events, such as floods, droughts, and storms, and to adapt to both immediate and long-term changes in climate. It involves not only surviving the immediate effects of a climate shock but also ensuring that communities can continue to develop and thrive despite ongoing and future climate challenges.    RAAWG's initiative emphasizes building these capacities through anticipatory actions—proactive measures taken before a climate shock occurs—to minimize harm, protect lives and livelihoods, and sustain progress in building long-term resilience.    To enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities by strengthening anticipatory action (AA) systems through coordinated efforts, harmonized triggers, aligned financing, and proactive advocacy.

Previously, RAAWG has undertaken mapping of activities on bi-annual basis informed by southern Africa's seasonality. ",,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POrbf4hkvE9NH21b93LhkyGiiy-lzyvl/edit?gid=607512659#gid=607512659,"For the Regional Anticipatory Action Working Group in Southern Africa, tracking progress, collecting data, and evaluating member organizations' performance are critical to ensuring the effectiveness of our initiatives. Here's how we approach this:    1. Tracking Progress     - Regular Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): RAAWG members establish a robust M&E framework at the onset of each project, which includes clear objectives, indicators, and targets aligned with our anticipatory action goals. This framework is used to track progress on an ongoing basis.     - Milestone Reviews: We conduct periodic milestone reviews, often quarterly, where member organizations report on the progress of their activities against the established indicators. These reviews help identify any deviations from the planned trajectory and allow for timely course corrections.    2. Data Collection     - Primary Data Collection: Member organizations are responsible for collecting primary data on the ground. This includes household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to gather qualitative and quantitative information on community resilience, preparedness levels, and the impact of anticipatory actions.     - Secondary Data Utilization: We also leverage secondary data from national meteorological agencies, disaster management authorities, and other relevant sources. This data is used to contextualize our primary data and enhance the accuracy of our analysis.     - Participatory Monitoring: Engaging local communities in the monitoring process is crucial. We involve community members in data collection efforts, training them to use simple tools like observation checklists or mobile data collection platforms. This ensures that the data reflects on-the-ground realities and empowers communities to take ownership of the outcomes.    3. Utilizing Metrics and Evaluation     - Standardized Metrics: We use a set of standardized metrics to evaluate member organizations' performance. These metrics are aligned with our overall goals, such as the number of people reached by early warning systems, the reduction in response time to climate shocks, or improvements in food security and livelihoods.     - Outcome and Impact Evaluation: Beyond output metrics, we conduct outcome and impact evaluations to assess the effectiveness of anticipatory actions. For example, we evaluate whether communities that received early warnings experienced fewer losses or recovered faster compared to those that did not.     - Dashboards and Reporting: To ensure transparency and facilitate decision-making, we use dashboards that provide real-time visualization of key metrics and progress indicators. These dashboards are accessible to all member organizations and are used during regular coordination meetings.    4. Feedback and Adaptation     - Feedback Loops: Continuous feedback loops are established where data is not only collected and analyzed but also fed back into the planning and implementation processes. This allows for adaptive management, where strategies can be adjusted based on what the data reveals.     - Capacity Building: We provide capacity-building sessions for member organizations on data collection methods, the use of digital tools, and the interpretation of data. This ensures that all members can effectively contribute to and benefit from the M&E processes.     - Learning and Sharing: We regularly organize learning sessions where member organizations can share their experiences, challenges, and successes related to data collection and performance evaluation. This collective learning helps to improve practices across the network.    5. Type of Data/Analysis Used     - Quantitative Data: This includes numerical data such as the number of beneficiaries, early warning dissemination reach, response times, and food security indices. We analyze this data to track progress against set targets and indicators.     - Qualitative Data: This includes narratives from community members, case studies, and observations from the field. We analyze this data to understand the context, community perceptions, and the social impact of our interventions.    By integrating these methods and processes, the Regional Anticipatory Action Working Group in Southern Africa ensures that data-driven insights inform our strategies, improve our interventions, and ultimately enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities in the region.    https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/southern-africa-regional-aa-working-group-anticipatory-action-drought-activations-2023-2024-june-2024",,Inserted data is triangulated with multiple sources and validated by our in-country counterparts. ,,n/a,,,Directly related,"In the context of anticipatory action in Southern Africa, the Regional Anticipatory Action Working Group places significant emphasis on strengthening food and agriculture systems to enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities against climate shocks. This is a specific focus for RAAWG's secretariat agencies WFP and FAO and closely linked to their core agency mandate. Here’s an overview of the outcomes and activities that our organization focuses on in relation to food and agriculture systems:    1. Early Warning Systems for Agriculture     - Outcome: Communities are better prepared for climate-induced agricultural disruptions through timely access to accurate early warning information.     - Activities:       - Climate and Crop Monitoring: We work with meteorological agencies and local partners to monitor weather patterns and crop conditions. This involves using satellite data, remote sensing, and ground observations to detect early signs of drought, flooding, or pest outbreaks.       - Dissemination of Alerts: Based on the data collected, we disseminate early warning alerts to farmers and agricultural stakeholders through SMS, radio broadcasts, and community meetings. These alerts provide actionable advice on planting, harvesting, or protective measures.    2. Pre-emptive Livelihood Support     - Outcome: Farmers and pastoralists are able to mitigate the impact of climate shocks on their livelihoods by receiving timely support before a crisis escalates.     - Activities:       - Distribution of Drought-Resistant Seeds: Before the onset of a predicted drought, we distribute drought-resistant seed varieties to farmers. These seeds are more likely to survive under harsh conditions, ensuring that farmers can still produce a harvest.       - Livestock Support: For pastoral communities, we organize pre-emptive livestock vaccinations and veterinary services to protect against diseases that typically spread during or after droughts. Additionally, we provide fodder and water supplies to sustain livestock during dry spells.       - Cash Transfers: In cases where agricultural activities are severely impacted, we implement cash transfer programs that provide farmers with the financial resources to meet their immediate needs or invest in adaptive strategies.    3. Sustainable Agricultural Practices     - Outcome: Farmers adopt sustainable agricultural practices that enhance resilience to climate variability and improve long-term food security.     - Activities:       - Conservation Agriculture Training: We conduct training sessions on conservation agriculture techniques, such as minimum tillage, crop rotation, and mulching. These practices help improve soil health, increase water retention, and reduce vulnerability to climate shocks.       - Agroforestry Promotion: We promote agroforestry, which integrates trees and shrubs into farming systems. This practice helps protect crops from extreme weather, improves soil fertility, and provides additional sources of income through products like fruit, nuts, and timber.       - Water Harvesting Techniques: We implement water harvesting projects, such as the construction of small dams, rainwater tanks, and contour bunds. These structures help communities capture and store rainwater, which can be used during dry periods to irrigate crops.    4. Market Access and Value Chain Support     - Outcome: Farmers have improved access to markets and value chains, enabling them to sell their produce and sustain their livelihoods even in the face of climate disruptions.     - Activities:       - Market Linkages: We facilitate connections between farmers and local or regional markets, including through cooperatives and farmer associations. This helps ensure that farmers can sell their produce even during times of uncertainty.       - Post-Harvest Management: We provide training and resources for post-harvest management, including storage facilities, drying techniques, and processing equipment. This reduces losses due to spoilage and increases the shelf life of agricultural products.       - Digital Platforms: In collaboration with technology partners, we support the development and use of digital platforms that connect farmers with buyers, provide market price information, and facilitate mobile payments.    5. Community-Based Resilience Building     - Outcome: Communities are empowered to lead resilience-building activities that enhance their food and agriculture systems.     - Activities:       - Participatory Planning: We engage communities in participatory planning processes to identify the specific risks they face and develop localized anticipatory action plans. These plans often include community-led initiatives like seed banks, community gardens, and local irrigation projects.       - Resilience Committees: We support the formation of resilience committees within communities. These committees are responsible for coordinating anticipatory actions, monitoring agricultural conditions, and mobilizing resources when a climate shock is anticipated.       - Knowledge Exchange: We facilitate knowledge exchange programs where communities can share best practices, traditional knowledge, and innovations in agriculture that have proven effective in enhancing resilience.    6. Research and Innovation     - Outcome: Cutting-edge research and innovative approaches are integrated into agricultural practices to address emerging challenges related to climate change.     - Activities:       - Climate-Smart Agriculture Research: We collaborate with research institutions to explore and test new climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies. This includes developing crop varieties that are more resilient to extreme weather, exploring alternative cropping systems, and piloting new irrigation technologies.       - Innovation Hubs: We establish innovation hubs where farmers, researchers, and practitioners can come together to experiment with new ideas, share experiences, and scale up successful practices.    7. Policy Advocacy and Collaboration     - Outcome: Agricultural policies and frameworks at local, national, and regional levels are strengthened to support anticipatory action and climate resilience.     - Activities:       - Policy Engagement: We engage with government bodies to advocate for policies that support anticipatory action in agriculture, such as subsidies for climate-resilient seeds, incentives for sustainable farming practices, and investment in rural infrastructure.       - Regional Collaboration: We work with regional organizations and networks to harmonize policies and strategies that promote resilient food systems across Southern Africa. This includes participating in regional forums and contributing to the development of regional disaster risk management frameworks.

The climate crisis, while a distant concept for some, is a harsh reality for millions worldwide. Rising temperatures have seen regions across the world dry up, resulting in terrible heat waves and flash floods that have left many communities unable to grow crops or generate income. Rural communities in northern Ghana affected by this lack of arable land are often left without a source of income for months, placing huge economic strain on families, especially women, and girls. Ultimately, families are forced to engage in rural-to-urban migration, while absenteeism from school and gender disparities also see dramatic increases within communities. This situation exacerbates the already existent problem of period poverty that women and girls in these arid regions are faced with as women and girls are forced to deprioritize purchasing menstrual products in the face of economic hardships. Instead, they turn to homemade alternatives including rugs, tissues, or plantain leaves which have serious health effects.  Addressing the Period Poverty struggle that women and girls are faced with requires inclusive and equitable interventions that are community-led, women-led, and intersectional, but also a sustainable investment in resilient livelihoods to provide economic empowerment for women. In most rural communities across Ghana, it is believed to be taboo for girls to engage in household activities or even interact with others when they are in their period. The already prevalent gender inequalities due to such taboos are constantly being widened as a result of lack of water which is a key element in menstrual hygiene. Women and girls have to walk for long distances, sometimes as long as 3km, to fetch water which further exposes them to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) as well as health complications, especially for pregnant women. This is why the Water for Adaptation and Period Poverty project is incredibly important. The project is a comprehensive approach to help create awareness and break myths surrounding menstruation and period poverty while working with communities, and stakeholders to produce reusable safe sanitary products and provide economic empowerment for women.    The Water for Adaptation and Period Poverty project has made significant strides in its second year of three years. The project has implemented education and awareness initiatives through training and community-led workshops aimed at demystifying taboos and helping communities understand the science behind menstruation. The project has also raised community awareness and fostered open discussions on menstrual hygiene among over 300 community members, including traditional and religious leaders, who are key stakeholders in breaking societal taboos surrounding menstruation.    Three boreholes have been successfully provided for safe drinking and washing to address the critical need for water. Approximately 1,000 adolescent girls in partner schools in the Kassena Nankana West District of the Upper East Region of Ghana have received comprehensive menstrual hygiene management (MHM) education. Additionally, through community engagement, the community, with our support, led the building of an Adaptation Resource Center to facilitate connections, idea-sharing, and movement building. This center will also serve as a location for the production of reusable sanitary pads and the training of women in alternative livelihoods. The next phase of the W4APP project aims to shift focus to critical areas that require dire attention. These areas include resource mobilization, climate and gender education, capacity building, and financial support for women-led businesses.  ","In our initiative, resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, and systems to absorb, adapt, and recover from the adverse effects of climate change, while also enhancing their ability to thrive in the face of future challenges. Climate resilience, in particular, refers to the ability of these communities to withstand and adapt to the impacts of climate-related events, such as droughts, floods, and changing weather patterns, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, especially women and girls.  In the context of the Water for Adaptation and Period Poverty (W4APP) project, climate resilience is embodied in the creation of sustainable, community-led solutions that address both the immediate and long-term challenges posed by climate change. By providing essential infrastructure like boreholes for safe drinking and washing as well as support their smallholder agricultural activities, the project enhances the community's ability to manage water scarcity—a critical issue exacerbated by climate change. The project's emphasis on menstrual hygiene management and the production of reusable sanitary pads ensures that women and girls are equipped with the knowledge and resources needed to maintain their health and dignity, even in the face of environmental stressors.  Moreover, the establishment of the Adaptation Resource Center exemplifies our commitment to building long-term resilience. This center not only serves as a hub for producing sustainable menstrual products but also as a space for training women in alternative livelihoods, thereby empowering them economically. By fostering these economic opportunities and providing comprehensive education on climate and gender, the W4APP project strengthens the community's ability to adapt to climate impacts, reduce vulnerabilities, and enhance their overall resilience.  Ultimately, resilience in our initiative is not just about surviving climate change but thriving despite it—through community empowerment, sustainable resource management, and the creation of equitable opportunities for all, especially the most vulnerable.

This ensures a holistic understanding of the impact of resilience actions on the ground. Our process includes the following steps:  1. Establishing Clear Metrics  We define specific KPIs that align with our goals, such as the number of women trained in sustainable livelihoods, the quantity of reusable sanitary pads produced, or the number of community workshops conducted. We also focus on outcomes, like improvements in menstrual hygiene management (MHM) practices, reduction in school absenteeism among girls, or increased access to clean water. In terms data collection, surveys are conducted among community members, particularly women and girls, to gather data on the direct impact of our interventions. These include pre- and post-intervention surveys to measure changes over time. Our team conducts on-site visits to observe activities and gather real-time data on project implementation, community participation, and infrastructure usage, such as boreholes. We facilitate FGDs with key stakeholders, including community leaders and beneficiaries, to collect qualitative insights into the effectiveness of our initiatives and gather feedback on areas needing improvement.  3. Data Analysis and Evaluation  Data from surveys and field observations are analyzed using statistical methods to track trends, measure progress against KPIs, and identify any gaps in implementation. Insights from FGDs and interviews are coded and analyzed thematically to understand the deeper social and cultural impacts of our work. This helps in assessing the community's perception of the initiative and the sustainability of the interventions. Periodic impact assessments are conducted to evaluate the broader outcomes of our initiatives, such as changes in gender equity, reduction in period poverty, and enhanced climate resilience in the communities we serve.  4. Utilizing Data for Continuous Improvement  Members are required to submit periodic reports using the standardized templates, which include both quantitative data and qualitative narratives. This data is compiled into comprehensive reports that are shared with stakeholders. We create feedback loops where findings from the data analysis are communicated back to the member organizations, allowing for real-time adjustments and improvements in their resilience actions.  5. Capacity Building  We provide training to member organizations on data collection for reporting to enhance their capacity for accurate and efficient data management.  ",,"We provide member organizations with clear, standardized data collection templates. This ensures consistency in the type of data collected and the methods used, reducing the risk of errors or discrepancies. We also conduct training sessions for member organizations on data collection methods, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, consistency, and ethical practices. In terms of cross-checking We use triangulation to cross-verify data by collecting it from multiple sources. For example, data on project outcomes is gathered through surveys, field observations, and focus group discussions, allowing us to compare and validate the information from different angles. In terms of data quality checks, we employ digital tools that include automated data quality checks. These tools flag potential errors, such as outliers, missing data, or inconsistencies, which are then reviewed and addressed by our team. We encourage iterative reporting, where member organizations can update or refine their data submissions based on our feedback, ensuring that the final data sets are as accurate and reliable as possible. We require detailed documentation of the data collection process from member organizations, including the methodologies used and any challenges encountered. This transparency helps us understand the context of the data and assess its reliability.",,"In addition to the previously mentioned tracking processes, our organization employs several other strategies to ensure comprehensive monitoring of progress and the effectiveness of our initiatives:  1. Community-Led Monitoring  We establish local monitoring committees composed of community members, particularly women and youth, who actively participate in tracking the progress of our projects. These committees provide real-time feedback and serve as a bridge between the community and our organization, ensuring that the initiatives are locally relevant and culturally appropriate. We incorporate PM&E practices, where community members are trained to collect and analyze data themselves. This approach empowers communities, fosters ownership of the projects, and ensures that the data collected reflects the local context and realities.  2. Impact Storytelling  Beyond quantitative metrics, we also track progress through impact storytelling. We gather narratives from beneficiaries and stakeholders that highlight the personal and social impacts of our initiatives. These stories provide a human perspective on the data, helping us understand the deeper, qualitative changes our projects are creating in communities. We use multimedia tools, including video and photography, to document progress and impact visually. This not only aids in tracking progress but also enhances our communication and advocacy efforts by sharing compelling stories of change with a broader audience.  3. Collaborative Learning and Knowledge Sharing  We organize peer learning sessions where member organizations and community partners share their experiences, challenges, and successes. These sessions facilitate knowledge exchange and help identify best practices that can be replicated or adapted across different projects. We maintain knowledge hubs—online platforms or physical centers—where data, reports, and insights from our projects are stored and made accessible to all stakeholders. This promotes transparency and continuous learning, allowing others to build on our work and contribute to collective resilience-building efforts.",,,Directly related,"The Water for Adaptation and Period Poverty (W4APP) project, while primarily focused on providing access to safe water and addressing period poverty and enhancing menstrual hygiene, also has significant positive impacts on food and agriculture systems, particularly for smallholder farmers in Kassena Nankana in the Upper East Region where the project operates. The boreholes provided through the W4APP project not only serve as a critical resource for drinking and hygiene purposes but also support smallholder farmers by providing a reliable source of water for irrigation. In some of the communities like Kandiga where water scarcity has made traditional farming methods difficult, this access to water enables farmers to cultivate crops even during dry seasons, thereby improving food security. By ensuring a steady water supply, the project helps smallholder farmers adapt to the unpredictable effects of climate change, such as erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts. This resilience is crucial for sustaining agricultural productivity and reducing the risk of crop failure. The project actively involves women in agricultural activities, recognizing their crucial role in food production and household food security. By providing access to water and training, the project empowers women to take on leadership roles in farming, thereby improving their livelihoods and contributing to gender equity in the agricultural sector.

This education has reached over 1,000 adolescent girls in the Kassena Nankana West District, significantly improving their menstrual health and reducing the stigma associated with menstruation. To address the issue of period poverty, the project has facilitated the production of reusable sanitary pads. Women in the community are trained to produce these pads, which are then distributed to girls and women who cannot afford commercial sanitary products. This initiative not only improves menstrual hygiene but also reduces health risks associated with using unsafe alternatives like rags or plantain leaves. The installation of the boreholes has provided communities with access to clean and safe water for drinking, washing, and agricultural use. Access to clean water is crucial for maintaining hygiene, particularly for women and girls during menstruation. This has directly contributed to reducing waterborne diseases and improving overall community health.

The ARA provides a forum that brings together research and action funders with active stakeholders along the full chain from research through to action, including research organisations, intermediary organisations, practitioners, civil society organisations, academic networks, science-policy-practice networks etc.    The ARA envisions a world by 2030 in which the research community is a highly valued partner to policymakers, practitioners and the most vulnerable communities, and engages effectively for the delivery of innovative, user-driven solutions for adaptation and resilience from the global to local levels.     The mission of the Adaptation Research Alliance is to accelerate and scale investments in action-oriented research in developing countries, that addresses the pressing knowledge needs for adaptation and resilience of the most vulnerable, builds capacity at all stages from research to action, strengthens research–implementation linkages, and promotes greater learning.     The ARA will lead to the following intended impacts:  - Enabling more effective adaptation and resilience actions that reduce climate risks to achieving societal goals in both developed and developing countries, particularly for the most vulnerable people, including women and girls, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, migrants and refugees, and other marginalised groups.  - Facilitating access to climate finance for adaptation through a stronger, more tailored, evidence base that also improves our understanding of what works.  - Increasing capacity in developing countries to do and use research to develop local adaptation and resilience solutions. ""","Resilience in the context of ARA can be understood as the capacity of individuals, communities, systems, and societies to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, and recover from the adverse effects of climate change in a timely and efficient manner. This involves not only bouncing back from shocks and stresses but also transforming and adapting to evolving risks and uncertainties.    Climate resilience builds upon this foundation by specifically addressing the challenges posed by climate change. It encompasses the ability to not only cope with the current impacts of climate change but also to prepare for and adapt to future climate-related hazards and vulnerabilities.    ARA emphasizes that resilience and climate resilience are not static states but rather dynamic processes that require continuous learning, adaptation, and transformation.

Catalyst Fund has historically tracked the growth of startups using a set of investor-focused metrics: users, revenue, employees, survival, fundraising rounds, and customer satisfaction (Net Promoter Score, or NPS). The number of customers is disaggregated by gender, disability, poverty status, and smallholder farmer occupation. This approach to measurement is informed by the fund’s theory of change. By deploying capital and consulting services, the fund improves the ability of startups to grow, expand, and raise capital. Due to the relatively short tenure of the process and Catalyst Fund’s lack of equity in the portfolio, successful exits or acquisitions were not tracked as a key performance indicator (KPI). Particular companies in the portfolio have additional impact metrics that are specific to their business model; but they are only reported when relevant. Such metrics could include land sustainably managed (ha); water conserved (L); reduction in carbon emissions (kg); or reduction in food waste (kg). Whenever possible, metrics are aligned with the GIIN/IRIS+ metrics, which streamlines reporting and aggregation of results. The targeting strategy of the fund’s investments is the stage at which social impact is considered most rigorously. Firms with founders and headquarters in Africa or low-income and lower-middle- income countries are eligible to join the portfolio. Selection criteria include inclusive business models that are accessible, affordable, and appropriate. Catalyst Fund does not deploy portfolio metrics or measurement to ascertain that the current portfolio and alumni are delivering on these metrics in a systematic way; but customer research is deployed regularly to assess the customer experience. As to the methodology, Catalyst Fund blends information from different sources. Portfolio companies are expected to participate in executive surveys that disclose revenue, fundraising, users, and hiring. Portfolio companies also participate in customer research that measures satisfaction and customer behavior. Catalyst Fund operates informal communications networks for executives of the portfolio companies where it is customary for executives to disclose funding milestones. Additionally, the Catalyst Fund team conducts independent desk research to validate findings using publicly available sources. The CIFAR Alliance primarily tracks the impact of its programs by counting its work products, rather than tangible impacts on end users’ adaptation and resilience. The main activities of the alliance are to hold working group meetings; to share learnings and best practices among members; to create reports and other knowledge products about climate adaptation and resilience; and to conduct events where we disseminate those learnings and reports. We count the knowledge products; the audiences for our social media and events; and the number of organizations that collaborate with us on our working groups.",,"The Catalyst Fund conducts research with portfolio companies’ customers using an independent vendor.

Scale for Resilience aims to create access to Nature-based Solutions (NbS )and enable the conditions and mechanisms to finance them by addressing the full financial value chain: it unites investors, (Micro-)Financial institutions as well facilitating institutions, like research centers and technology providers. The goal of the initiative is to leverage ICT solutions for the assessment and reporting of the productive needs of vulnerable populations in the context of climate change and address them by financing suitable Nature-based Solutions. To do so, Scale for Resilience, promotes digital tools that include physical climate risk assessment in the credit assessment of Financial Service providers as well as dedicated taxonomies of resilience-enhancing investments targets, like NbS. Equipped with these tools financial service providers can address existing climate vulnerabilities among vulnerable populations in an informed manner through green loan products financing NbS. Financial Service providers thereby become agents of change, so do investors supporting these financial service providers in their journey to channel investments where they are needed most and create the highest impact. Technology and Research are key ingredients to our approach.   The digital MRV system (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) provided by YAPU Solutions not only allows for the inclusion of physical climate risks in the credit assessment, but also the transparent verification and reporting of green credits financing Nature-based and other climate solutions, which increase resilience. This allows financial service providers to validate the most successful NbS, while investors get a granular picture of the impact of their portfolio excluding the possibility of greenwashing.   Research, on the other hand, is crucial to provide a sound basis for the measurement of physical climate risks. Even more so, due to the highly local nature of climate adaptation, it is needed find ways to effectively address the needs of vulnerable sub-groups, like e.g. women, which are disproportionally worse affected by climate change. Successful adaptation strategies need to be backed by scientific data on local climate change impacts as well as the benefits different Nature-based Solutions offer to address them. Structuring this information systematically in dedicated taxonomies aiming to improve resilience is a prerequisite to take effective investment decisions.  Based on this approach Scale for Resilience seeks to address three key barriers that prevent the scaling of finance for adaptation and resilience:  1.      Insufficient availability and adoption of climate risk data and tools.  2.     Perceived lack of profitable investments.  3.     Perceived low commercial readiness of adaptation and resilient solutions.  Scale for Resilience is creating an inclusive, living ecosystem, based on its members, which fosters cooperation, knowledge sharing, visibility and technical assistance. All geared towards making 3.000.000 vulnerable populations more resilient against climate change. ","We define climate resilience as part of a wider resilience concept, encompassing the exposure to specific threats, an individual’s or company’s sensitivity to these same threats as well as the individual’s or company’s adaptive capacity to withstand adverse impacts and consequences of these threats. We thereby focus on a user-centric perspective: what solutions and strategies do the most vulnerable populations require to live resilient lives. To that end we have established a resilience taxonomy which encompasses 4 dimensions of resilience enhancement in the areas of climate, nature, health and socio-economic resilience.    For the climate resilience dimension, we seek to increase adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable vis-à-vis currently 5 sub-dimensions (storms, flooding, drought, extreme heat and frost – expansion foreseen towards 2025) in 6 economic sectors (agriculture, animal husbandry, housing, service, trade, manufacturing). The taxonomy is accompanied by a resilience finance taxonomy compendium composed of over 400 global adaptation and resilience solutions as investment targets – each of the items is to be scored in the different resilience dimensions and sub-dimensions. The scoring is set up initially based on expert inputs, but increasingly to be driven by data analytics (at YAPU, we are currently developing a deep/machine learning and artificial intelligence framework to guide these analytics automatically). The scoring is not yet complete for all solutions and across all dimensions and sub-dimensions, focus has been laid on climate resilience but we expect and ongoing consolidation with the other three dimensions (nature, health, socio-economics – each of these with pre-defined sub-dimensions).

Founded in April 2018, Resilience First is a not-for-profit organisation, led and funded by business to strengthen collective private sector resilience. The initiative aims to make the difference between success and failure for any business community facing major challenges or severe disruption. Through thought leadership, advocacy, and cross-sector collaboration, Resilience First advances a collective vision for sustainable and resilient business transforming communities around the globe.    Businesses, as the world's economic engines, will face the mounting shocks and stressors amplified by climate change. Businesses must improve their resilience by building adaptive capacity alongside their decarbonization efforts if they seek to thrive over the next several decades. By extension, where businesses thrive and support local economies, communities will be better positioned to also withstand the impacts of climate change. Building climate resilience presents a systems-focused transformational approach to mitigate and absorb the negative and cascading impacts of climate change and to address the inherent, rapidly evolving uncertainty that businesses and their communities face.    Through our programmes and campaigns, Resilience First will enable businesses across industry sectors to collaborate, share best practice, and co-create innovative solutions to accelerate climate resilience globally. By strengthening the business case for investing in resilience across industry sectors, engaging key stakeholders globally and developing a universal framework for businesses to advance climate resilience, we aim to galvanise the private sector to substantially scale-up its investment in resilience, improve resilience in the communities where they operate, and position businesses to advocate for policies that strengthen climate resilience.

Regions4 is the global voice of subnational governments before UN negotiations, European Union initiatives and global discussions in the fields of climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development. Its flagship initiative RegionsAdapt was launched at COP 21 as the first global platform that supports the acceleration of climate change adaptation by subnational governments. Gathering more than 70 Regions representing over 270 million citizens, RegionsAdapt inspires and supports subnational governments to develop ambitious climate change strategies, implement concrete adaptation actions, and transparently report on progress. Through advocacy,  knowledge sharing and capacity building, RegionsAdapt catalyses innovations in climate adaptation, fosters cooperation and helps regional governments develop actions plans that improve their resilience. ","While there is not single definition of climate resilience, RegionsAdapt supports the IPCC’s definition that “resilience is the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure. Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains capacity for adaptation, learning and/or transformation (IPCC 2022).    So, when we look at resilience from our initiative’s perspective, we look at the ability of regions to increase their adaptative capacity to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, droughts, and heatwaves, through a four steps pathway that includes:    Assessing climate vulnerabilities  Planning adaptation strategies, plans or programme  Implementing adaptation measures to understand and minimize territorial and social vulnerability, and enhance adaptive capacity (diversifying economies, building robust infrastructure, ensuring social equity, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, sustainable water and forest management....)   Monitor and Report progress   We also advocate for cross -sectoral approaches, as for example we emphasize the importance of preserving and restoring ecosystems as a key component of resilience. Healthy ecosystems provide essential services such as flood protection, water purification, and carbon sequestration, which are crucial for the well-being of communities and the resilience of regional economies.    Last, resilience should also be achieved in policy and governance: at Regions4, we emphasize the importance of effective governance structures and policies that promote sustainable development and climate resilience at the regional level. This involves, among others, strengthening legal frameworks, promoting multi-level governance approaches, and fostering collaboration among different stakeholders.    Resilience Building Plan survey calculation method:    RegionsAdapt relies on self-reported information from its members through the CDP 2023 States and Regions questionnaire.       There were two options possible for tracking impact:    Option A: Focus on tracking the progress of regional adaptation planning.     This  would have involved evaluating how many regions have developed adaptation plans and assuming these plans cover their entire jurisdiction and benefit their entire population. However, this option hasn't been chosen for the moment.    Option B: Focus on tracking the progress of regional adaptation actions.     In this reporting exercise, we looked at the adaptation actions reported in 2023 by states and regions through the CDP. In 2023, 174 actions were reported, and for 33 of these actions, the “proportion of the total jurisdiction population with increased resilience due to adaptation action” was estimated by the regions.    The total impact was calculated by multiplying the total jurisdiction population by the midpoint/median of the range option for each of these 33 actions, resulting in a total impact of 66,734,417.

Disturbingly, looking at CDP 2022 data, 74% of disclosing RegionsAdapt members acknowledged that climate hazards would impact vulnerable communities. However, there is hope in the pivotal role of subnational governments - states, provinces, and regions - in bolstering climate change resilience for these marginalized groups. Being closer to the ground, these governments possess an intimate understanding of local challenges and needs. By prioritizing inclusive policies, targeted funding, and community engagement, they tailor measures to address the specific vulnerabilities faced by women, girls, the elderly, children, indigenous and ethnic minorities, low income communities, disabled individuals, amongst others.

We would appreciate if you could  ust it in your progress report, COP28 publications and activities.  According to 2023 reporting, we might update it in september  ---  Subnational governments are actively taking various actions to combat climate change in the food and agriculture systems. As reported through CDP and highlighted in the RegionsAdapt annual reports, they prioritize long-term planning by incorporating climate change considerations and employ specific techniques at the farm level, such as salinity monitoring and subsurface drainage. They also establish state-wide ecological performance measures to monitor forest ecosystem conditions and allocate funds to regulate timber management and support forest restoration.     Multi-governance collaborations allow for adaptation projects for vulnerable sectors like agriculture and livestock. Initiatives include agroforestry and grazing systems, sustainable production practices, and soil and water conservation measures. By disseminating weather information and promoting short-cycle seeds, they facilitate climate-resilient agricultural practices and enhance farmers' technical capacities. Moreover, subnational governments incentivize conservation agriculture, minimum soil disturbance, and biodiversity conservation to improve water and nutrient use efficiency and overall crop production.     Subnational governments support the adoption of sustainable farming systems, invest in regenerative agriculture, and investigate ways to reduce livestock emissions through various measures. Additionally, they engage in seaweed farming for carbon reduction and nutrient offset. Through programs and partnerships, they promote sustainable land management, water use efficiency, and irrigation improvements. They also encourage market gardening and off-season food crops while raising awareness about the importance of sustainable cultivation practices. Overall, these actions contribute to building climate resilience in vulnerable communities and enhancing the sustainability of food and agriculture systems.

",Directly related,"Subnational governments are using planning, legislation, and regulations as crucial tools in their fight against climate change. Various regions have introduced comprehensive laws and plans to address climate-related challenges. For instance, Catalonia explained that the decisive factor for progress in adaptation has been the approval of the Climate Change Law of Catalonia in 2017. In Québec, a law on effective governance of climate change and electrification obliges the government to develop methodologies and guidelines for adaptation that consider future climate evolution. In São Paulo, a state decree on climate change that includes adaptation was signed in July 2021.           There has also been undeniable progress in mainstreaming adaptation in other sectors along with better coordination between departments. This has been facilitated in some cases by the creation of coordination mechanisms focused on climate change, such as in Catalonia (Spain), Guanajuato and Jalisco (Mexico), Flanders (Belgium), Cross River State (Nigeria),           They are also actively engaging citizens and incorporating diverse perspectives in the development of climate strategies, as demonstrated by the participatory process in Catalonia.

Other measures include providing financial support for conservation agriculture practices, funding resiliency initiatives for heat and intense rainfall, and facilitating payments for environmental services.           In industrialized countries, some innovative paths are created to allow regions to create their own resources: in Québec, for instance, all climate actions are financed by their carbon market and government credits, whereas the Catalan climate fund for mitigation and adaptation policies is financed through different taxes, such as the tax on CO2 emissions from cars, motorbikes and commercial vans, which raises around 150 million euros per year (estimate year 2022). Fifty percent of this goes to climate policies and the other 50% to the biodiversity fund. The Lombardy region established the Fund for Green Areas, which compensates for the environmental loss due to soil use and transformation. At the moment, 98 hectares of regional territory are subjected to interventions financed by the fund with total resources invested of 5,5 million euro (5,2 million euro from regional funds)

The CRI aims to inform important decisions for both the public and private sector. It enables insurers to price risk more accurately, as well as support investors and the development sector in mapping both potential future liabilities and investment opportunities where nature-based solutions provide resilience benefits.   It also seeks to support public policymakers in understanding the exposure of their communities to coastal hazards while demonstrating the importance of proactive coastal ecosystem management in building resilience. This in turn could lead to more robust risk reduction strategies to protect and restore these natural assets around the world.    ORRAA also supports several knowledge products that aim to inform stakeholders in the coastal and ocean resilience space. This includes the Climate and Ocean Risk Vulnerability Index (CORVI), which is a risk assessment tool for decision making to identify and address vulnerabilities and risks in Small Island Developing states and coastal cities.     We also supported the Stockholm Resilience Centre in conducting three studies on opportunities and risk in the blue acceleration and the gender-based impacts of ocean risks in the SIDS and LDCs, as well as a report on the need for improved governance and sustainability in the ocean sands sector.

ORRAA is doing this in three ways.      First, we are building from the ground-up: nurturing the development of a locally led investable project pipeline that delivers climate, nature, and gender positive outcomes.      Second, we are tackling the ‘missing middle’, to enable greater private sector investment into smaller impact-driven coastal and Ocean resilience products and projects which deliver a market-based return.      Finally, we are delivering a step-change in investment, working from the top-down by developing the Sea Change Impact Financing Facility (SCIFF) – the foundational elements for a global Ocean financing ecosystem to deploy private sector, sovereign, and regional level investment at scale and help de-risk investable opportunities.    To drive this, we partner with our members, 20 of whom are from the finance sector including AXA, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Swiss Re, WTW and more, and support over 30 projects focused on financial innovation. To develop the SCIFF, we are also undertaking work to scope the feasibility of five key elements: The Outrigger Impact Fund, a Blue Bond Incubator, a Blue Resilience Replenishment Fund, a Blue Guarantee Facility, and a Catalytic Blue Resilience Fund.

The JRT theory of change focuses on achieving our vision of sustainable, resilient, and people-centred food systems that nourish a growing global population while protecting the natural systems which sustain life. This process consists of increased evidence generation and research synthesis, scaled buy-in to a just rural transition as a movement, and scaled buy-in to a just rural transition as a concept.

In the short-term, we aim to see greater capacity amongst policymakers, investors, and other representatives to assess and design inclusive policy solutions, greater buy-in for the repurposing of public support provided to food and agriculture across stakeholders at all levels, and JRT communication outputs concerning innovative policy and investment solutions influencing stakeholder practice. These lead into the medium-term outcomes of concrete policies and policy levers being agreed by national governments, and greater investment being incentivised to finance transformative food and land use system solutions. In the long-term, we are working towards the enacting of transformative agricultural policies which support food producers, marginalised communities, and sustainable food systems.

They build financial resilience and reduce  vulnerabilities to climate, socio-economic, health and  disaster risks and shocks, providing a critical safety net for  millions, and protecting assets, lives and livelihoods.  Moreover, scaling up insurance coverage incentivizes and  drives forward economic growth by reducing budgetary  pressure on governments and households through the  provision of reliable financing in the wake of a crisis. This  assurance allows both families and governments to invest  more than they would otherwise, safe in the knowledge  that critical assets and livelihoods are protected. In turn, all  this new investment itself would demand more insurance to  lock in resilience, again stimulating new investment.  Despite the advantages, insurance and risk financing  solutions have not been fully utilized. In developing  countries, only 3 to 7 percent of people with low and  middle income have insurance coverage.

Despite the mounting impacts of climate change, one in three people are still not adequately covered by early warning systems, and early and anticipatory approaches - enabling action in advance of hazards striking - are not implemented at the scale required.  Yet we know early warning and early action can save lives and assets worth at least ten times their cost.    We create a space in which partners and aligned organizations use our ambitious targets to drive a systemic shift towards acting earlier to reduce the impacts of disasters, mobilize commitments and inspire action. We do not create a new funding mechanism or directly implement ground-level projects; however, we seek to enable coherence, alignment and complementarity of existing initiatives, while learning together what new initiatives are needed to make 1 billion people safer from disasters.     Our partners agree that only by working together across sectoral silos and involving those at risk, can global ability to act ahead of climate extremes and disasters be strengthened. REAP was launched with the announcement of four targets, each of which contribute to making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025. Developed by the convening partners of REAP, these ambitious targets are achievable only through partnership and a shared commitment to joined-up, risk-informed early action.     - Target 1: By 2025, 50 countries have reviewed and integrated their crisis/disaster risk management, climate adaptation laws, policies and/or plans to ensure that they reduce climate change impacts and exposure on - -people and the environment.   - Target 2: By 2025, 1 billion more people are covered by financing and delivery mechanisms connected to effective early action plans, ensuring they can act ahead of predicted disasters and crises.   - Target 3: By 2025, USD 500 million invested in early warning system infrastructure and institutions to target early action in ‘last/first mile’ communities, building on existing initiatives.   - Target 4: By 2025, 1 billion more people are covered by new or improved early warning systems, including heatwave early warning, connected to longer-term risk management systems, and supported by effective risk communication and public stakeholder dialogue to prompt informed action.""",,https://www.early-action-reap.org/,,,,,,,,,,,We target last/first mile communities - the most vulnerable and marginalised who are typically the last to receive assistance.,,Oceania & Pacific,East Asia,South Asia,East Europe & Central Asia,Northern & Western Europe,North Africa and the Middle East,Sub-Saharan Africa,South America,Central America and Caribbean,North America,,Yes,,Implementer: An organization that carries out resilience activities on the ground.,Collaborator/Partner Organization: Supports the initiative's operations without implementing actions on the ground.,Endorser: Provides other types of support.,Donor: Funds the initiative.,0,Yes,Commitment to the goals of REAP,None at present,In development,Member_prefilled_Risk-informedEarlyActionPartnership.pdf,,"We don't evaluate the performance of Partners.

DARAJA enables the inclusive co-design and delivery of actionable weather and early warning information by and for people living in urban informal settlements.  DARAJA operates a city system-wide approach to building ‘bridges’ - operational partnerships, media channels, and feedback loops between the actors needed in the city and settlement weather information system. These include but are not limited to  residents, community groups, city hall, city media, Red Cross, national weather forecasters and climate scientists. The overarching aim is to reduce loss of life and improve the livelihoods of urban communities who are vulnerable to the impacts of weather and climate, which ultimately results in reduced vulnerability and enhanced climate resilience.     DARAJA has 4 focus areas to achieve this aim - strengthening weather and climate information (WCI) products, strengthening the services, improving adaptive capacity, and developing partnerships.     DARAJA believes that climate resilience can be enhanced:  1. If WCI is relevant, understandable and useful (focus on strengthening the product).  2. WCI is provided at the right time, in the right format (and language) and through the best channels (focus on strengthening the service)  3. the capacity of communities to be able to prepare for and respond to weather/ climate impacts/ events is strengthened (focus on building adaptive capacity),   4. Partnerships across community systems are developed or strengthened (focus on strengthening the system). In terms of measurable goals, the key set of indicators are around increasing access to WCI, understanding it, and using WCI to take action at a community level.

The projects use the core MEL methodology, including the survey and interview questionnaires for data collecion. This means all the projects are tracking the same indicators largely using the same tools. This methodology and related tools have been collaboratively developed by Resurgence and the first implementation partners. The survey tools are contextualised/ adapted by the implementation partners (with Resurgence's input) for their specific context. Projects have three data collection and analysis activities - baseline (start of project), ongoing analysis (periodically throughout the project at a targeted scale), and endline (end of project). The baseline helps the project understand the starting point and provides information for intervention design. The ongoing analysis enables projects to track progress against the indicators and make design adjustments. The endline allows the project to assess the impact against the indicators. The MEL plan uses a mixed-methods approach. Data is collected primarily through household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Secondarily, observations of implementing partners, workshop outcomes and documentation feed into the data analysis as well. The project uses quantitative and qualitative data, mainly primary data and also some secondary data. The analysis is done collaboratively by Resurgence and the implementation partners.",,"As the programme lead, Resurgence is involved in the enttire process, from the MEL design to analysis and validation. The MEL methodology is designed to triangulate the data. Data colelction on the ground is led by implementation partners while data analysis is done collaboratively by Resurgence and the implementation partners. The findings are then validated with the larger stakeholder group which includes target community members, institutions, city authorities, etc. Adjustments are made following the validation. During the baseline stage, the validation exercise is followed by workshops to co-design the interventions. At the endline stage, validation is followed by a learning exercise to draw out key lessons from the project.",,"Attached is the broad MEL framework for DARAJA projects.
