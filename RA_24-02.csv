Climate change, environmental injustice, and racial inequity are systemic outcomes of colonization: the exploitative extraction of natural and human resources to generate profit for the few. Solutions that do not directly address these common causes will not succeed. Successful solutions prioritize the most marginalized. We believe that to design better solutions, we must practice targeted universalism, prioritizing those who experience the most vulnerability to climate change, disproportionate exposure to environmental injustice, and the biggest barriers to benefiting from climate solutions. By doing so, we will produce solutions that meet the needs of everyone. By not doing so, we are upholding current disparities.  Prioritizing marginalized communities means leading with race. Race is the leading predictor of outcomes across the United States and Canada, yet governments have not systemically acknowledged or addressed disparities by race or their role in creating them. Because of this, racial analysis must be a priority. “Leading with race” does not mean “only race.” It is a practice of starting with a racial equity analysis to understand how race impacts outcomes, recognizing how the intersectionality of identities and groups also impacts outcomes.   Equity is a professional competency. The skills associated with advancing equity make us better public servants, preparing us to deal with the complex nature of the social, economic, and environmental challenges our communities face.   Equity is responsible governance. The government has a fiscal and moral responsibility to address the long-term implications that inequity has on prosperity, health, and safety for residents and stakeholders. Governments can either create or eliminate barriers for better outcomes through their policies, programs, and relationships.    Diversity is an asset. Increasing diversity within the sustainability field, and particularly in decision-making positions within government, will increase the long-term relevance and accountability of our work to communities who have been systematically denied influence. Diverse perspectives produce more sophisticated solutions. To diversify successfully, the sustainability field must consciously build an inclusive culture.  Equity Commitments  USDN commits to:    Creating a learning community. Developing equitable solutions that will produce the change needed in our communities will be hard, complicated work. USDN is a space for us to be authentic and make mistakes, but it will also push us to do better and be better.    Supporting our members’ individual racial equity work. To build our professional competency and confidence in racial equity work, we must honor the vulnerability, courage, and humanity required. Although systemic racism negatively impacts us all, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color bodies and white bodies will have different needs, from healing to humility. We will support each member’s individual anti-racism practice.   Building the pipeline of diverse sustainability professionals and developing leaders. We are committed to using our positional power and influence to attract, train, and retain members from communities underrepresented in the sustainability field, particularly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color practitioners. We also commit to creating growth and leadership opportunities for these individuals.  Structuring USDN funding and resources to support our equity principles. USDN will use our equity principles to inform staffing, programming, and budget decisions for both our organization and the funds we make available to members.  Accelerating adoption of equity values and commitments in our field of practice. USDN will work with partners that share our values, and we will use our organizational influence to set an example of racial equity work for our community of practice.   Creating an inclusive culture. USDN will create spaces where members, staff, and partners feel welcome to participate fully with their identities, experiences, and positions.   Being accountable to our principles. USDN will evaluate and publicly report on how we are living up to our explicitly stated equity principles and our opportunities to do better.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Women and girls;LGTBQIA+ people;Elderly;Children & Youth;Indigenous and traditional communities;Racial, ethnic or religious minorities;;Disabled People;Low income communities;;VMC are partners/co-leads in the project/action;;;;;;;Involvement and impact are intentional;;Resilience Hubs are intentionally prioritized and centered on the most marginalized communities and people where the need is highest. This is a core component of Resilience Hubs and the reason we center humans over hazards. Resilience Hubs are centers for shifting power from government to community members and partners that live within a specific neighborhood. The intention is to increase autonomy, community adaptive capacity, social cohesiveness and connectivity.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Resilience Hubs provide an opportunity to work at the intersection of racial equity, climate resilience, and GHG mitigation. For decades local governments have focused more on technological approaches and solutions rather than centering work on enhancing quality of life and respectful relationships with the surrounding environment. Hubs provide an opportunity to reframe project processes and truly put the needs of frontline communities first.    Resilience Hubs are an opportunity to be proactive and to anticipate future climate conditions while also plan to accommodate future changes in technology. Programming, services, and site retrofits should take into account future increases in volatility and variability of climate conditions while also providing opportunities to integrate future technology that may be cost prohibitive or lack political will in current conditions.     Hubs center proactive preparedness and connect community members and partners in a trusted neighborhood space that supports training, connectivity and storage of necessary supplies. Additionally, Hubs are retrofitted as centers for response and recovery and provide additional support to community members who may need access to information, supplies, resources, support, etc.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Resilience Hubs require planning and proactive preparedness for all types of disruptions, including impacts from a changing climate. They are neighborhood centered but also connect and contribute to City and County plans for preparedness, sustainability, climate adaptation, climate resilience and climate action. Resilience Hubs are featured in local government Hazard Mitigation Plans and Resilience Plans across North America. They provide nodes for risk reduction through both soft and hard infrastructure implementation.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;USDN brings local government practitioners and their community-based partners and community members together to learn, collaborate, and accelerate the work of climate resilience, climate action and sustainability. There are Resilience Hub workshops, trainings, learning sessions and coaching opportunities provided to network members and their partners throughout the year. These workshops focus on equipping Resilience Hub teams with the knowledge, resources, and partnerships they need to succeed in developing their Hubs. USDN helps advance change locally in member communities as well as across the field of practice. The aggregate impact and influence of our collective work makes an equitable, resilient, and sustainable society more attainable.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;USDN provides workshops, trainings, coaching and 1-1 support for members and their partners working on Resilience Hubs. USDN also supports and Resilience Hub Community of Practice centered on learning and increasing resilience for all participants. There are three tiers (beginner, intermediate and advanced) for USDN members to learn from each other and learn from USDN staff. These learning opportunities increase resilience for communities as well as for government interested in shifting resources and power to community members.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;USDN Resilience Hubs are focused on increasing marginalized communities autonomy and self-determination. They center in holistic and year-round resilience that focuses on making communities resilient every day and in the event of a disruption/hazard. The entire intent is to shift power, resources and capacity to communities and away from discriminatory government systems and structures.     The targeted beneficiaries are community members and partners in neighborhoods that have been most marginalized and disenfranchised by discriminatory policies and practices. This intentional discrimination has led to increased risk and vulnerability. The focus of Resilience Hubs are to center these most marginalized communities and provide funding, resources, capacity and ongoing support for them to increase neighborhood autonomy.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions.;USDN Resilience Hubs seek to actively shift power to the most marginalized communities with the intent of neighborhoods leading their own resilience efforts and determining their year-round needs. It provides a neighborhood-based space for community to gather, connect, and focus on efforts to increase social connectivity and collaboration. Hubs also ensure that local community members and Community Based Partners become the leaders of the efforts in their communities. Youth leadership is incredibly important and youth ambassadors are encouraged to acquire skills and engage with trainings that support them in become Resilience Hub leaders. Additionally, seniors and women are prioritized in leadership.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Resilience is never complete, nor is a Resilience Hub. By nature, Resilience Hub components will evolve over time to align with changing climates, contexts, and hyper local needs and assets. Identifying core ‘base’ hub components in addition to longer term ‘optimal’ and ‘ideal’ site elements helps to move away from a ‘check box’ approach by identifying a pathway of incremental steps towards transformational change. Decision-making power is intentionally centered in the neighborhoods and with the community members in the area they serve. When local neighborhood-based leaders and community members are the decision-makers, the needs of the community are prioritized over the assumptions of government. Resilience Hubs provide a local space for collective decision-making and the five foundational areas provide scaffolding to ensure resilience increases through those decisions.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;"Resilient communities are equitable communities. Resilience Hubs provide an opportunity to consider communities’ social, economic and physical needs in normal/everyday mode which, in turn, enhances their ability to anticipate, accommodate and more quickly recover during disruption. Hubs are a way to solve for multiple different problems in all three resilience modes by enhancing community cohesion, building trust, shifting power, and enhancing quality of life. Community members are the leaders, designers, and co-implementers of Hubs. They are both collaborators in the design but also center collective connection and participation. The entire process of planning, designing, developing and implementing a Resilience Hub is anchored in collective participation, increasing social cohesiveness and belonging. That is why it is critical that community members lead and have ""ownership"" over Hubs and their activities/functions. ";;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;One of the five foundational areas for Resilience Hubs is Resilient Communication. This is a critical element of any successful Hub. Hubs provide nodes and spaces for enhanced communication channels between individuals and groups within a specific neighborhood. They provide a meeting place and space for community members to exchange ideas and information while also learning from each other. This includes access to communication equipment (computers, wifi, radios, etc.) and access to each other at the site through designated spaces and programs. Increasing communication and relationship-building increases resilience throughout the community and leads to more trust and connectivity.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;USDN is a network. This is the way we function. We believe a diverse, inclusive, and equity-centered approach is essential to achieving our mission and that local governments have both an influential role and an inherent responsibility within the movement toward equitable, resilient, and sustainable communities.    Meaningful, long-lasting change happens from the ground up through a collaborative approach  where local governments work with the communities they serve.  By working with each other and their communities, local government sustainability practitioners can  accelerate transformative change.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;There is no 'one size fits all' for Resilience Hubs. All communities and neighborhoods are unique. The entire Resilience Hub initiative is adaptable, flexible and intended to meet communities where they are. It builds upon existing services and functions and fills the gaps necessary to become more resilient. See resilience-hub.org for more information.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;USDN Resilience Hubs are centered in neighborhoods and are intended to provide redundancy and reduce the impact on emergency services while also providing a funnel for information year-round. They are enhanced to provide food, water, supplies, resources and services in disruption but also services and programs that benefit the community year-round. Redundancy is a key element of Resilience Hubs and they support communication, clean air/water/food, information, power, and additional support services.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;Resilience Hubs support community in understanding insurance and also filing insurance claims after a disruption. They also are focal points for community to connect on energy saving and weatherization programs/opportunities and also places to center economic/job opportunities. The finance benefits alter and adjust based on the neighborhood they serve. USDN also supports finding and getting federal funding and support for Hubs. This has been an ongoing process and links to several federal agencies.;;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;Resilience Hubs have five foundational areas. One of those areas is Buildings and Landscape. Landscape changes such as tree plantings, local shade plants, mental health spaces, and opportunities to benefit surrounding ecosystem services is an important component of Hubs. USDN intends to continue building upon this opportunity and support documents around natural resources as our community of practice advances.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;Resilient power systems, resilient communications and resilient operations are three of the foundational areas for USDN Resilience Hubs. Each of those have technological elements that are intended to support communities and enhance resilience. For example, resilient power focuses on renewable energy systems and battery backup as the core implementation to increase resilience and improve GHG reduction opportunities. There are several other technologies around water, air purification, weatherization, etc. that utilize advanced technologies to improve resilience.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Resilience Hubs focus on social infrastructure above all else. However, they also have building upgrades and other technology/systems upgrades that improve surrounding infrastructure. This can include stormwater services through raingardens and plantings, reduced energy use through shade tree plantings and building skins, and other small infrastructure improvements such as floodproofing and energy upgrades.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Social cohesion, connectivity and collaboration are the KEY and core element of USDN Resilience Hubs. Communities will only be resilient if they are socially connected and supported. Thus, Resilience Hubs focus on everyday services and programs that benefit community members as well as services in the event of any disruption. They focus on holistic resilience and center humans over the hazards.;;Please see resilience-hub.org or usdn.org for more information or contact baja@usdn.org

The ARA brings together funders, researchers, practitioners to catalyze increased investment in action-oriented research, providing a common platform for planning research and its uptake, for climate adaptation and resilience. ARA members endorse the 6 Adaptation Research for Impact Principles, which include the recognition research priorities and agendas should be set through open and inclusive processes that reflect all stakeholder contexts, needs and interests. Furthermore, the Principles highlight that power relations manifest through intersectional, gender-based, economic, social, and political inequities, which are often the root causes of vulnerability. In 2021 the ARA carried out a Consultative Process on Gender and Social Inequality to surface priorities and recommendations for research that advances gender equity and social inclusion in the context of climate change. A summary report from the Consultative Process proposes key emerging action research priorities. An example from 2022: the ARA funded 25 micro-grant projects which were led by southern based organisations to identify burning issues affecting local communities, with the intention that the communities needs were well understood. These projects set a foundation for community interventions that can improve equity considerations.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;;;;;;;;;;The mission and intended impacts in the ARA Theory of Change underpin the need for action-oriented adaptation research that leads to capacity-building and enhances the resilience of those most vulnerable to current and future climate risks.

To achieve this, ORRAA is driving the creation of a new global ocean finance ecosystem to enable  a  step  change  in  the  scale  of  climate  finance  channelled  towards  the  Ocean  and coastal communities. ORRAA  supports  coastal  and  Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS) that  are  directly  threatened  by  the  impacts  of  climate  change  by  piloting  and  scaling innovative   finance   projects   that   will   leverage   greater   private   investment   in   coastal resilience.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;The heart of ORRAA’s mission is focused on building the resilience and adaptive capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems and the coastal communities around the world that rely on them.  We do this by driving investment into ocean and coastal Nature Based Solutions (NBS), as well as through the mitigation of risk multipliers like overfishing and pollution. These solutions will enable the ocean and the communities which depend on it to thrive, creating greater economic security as well as social and cultural resilience for climate vulnerable coastal communities.

While DARAJA operates at the city-level, it also focuses on target informal settlements with high vulnerability levels. Avoided loss/savings is a key indicator for the programme. The logic is that people (incl business owners, esp SMEs) will be able to access and use weather information to take early action which protects their assets or belongings, thereby avoiding material/financial loss. On the other hand, this information can be used to plan alternatives or take business decisions that enhance income generation. Ultimately, this will lead to improved financial resilience.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Women and girls;;Elderly;Children & Youth;Indigenous and traditional communities;;;Disabled People;Low income communities;;VMC are partners/co-leads in the project/action;VMC are consulted (unidirectional) prior to the project/action;VMC are consulted (unidirectional) during the project/action;VMC co-construct the content of the project/action;;;;Involvement and impact are intentional;;This urban informal settlement population is usually left behind in critical public services and is not consulted when designing new services. Co-production is a central pillar of DARAJA. DARAJA's approach enables dialogue between marginalised communities and service providers such as the National Meteorological Service. Apart from increasing their access to weather information, this process supports the co-design of user-centric products and services, increases a sense of ownership of it in the community, and builds trust between them. All key decisions of the project are made collaboratively with this stakeholder group, usually in a workshop format.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;"DARAJA’s core output is a strengthened weather information system (including forecasts and early warnings). This involves 1) increasing community’s access to forecasts and early warnings; 2) improving the forecasts to be more understandable and relevant to communities’ needs, making it more impact-based and therefore, more actionable; 3) supporting communities to identify anticipatory actions that can be taken to prepare for extreme weather impacts.";;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;Near-term anticipatory actions are identified based on forecasts through workshops and participatory exercises at the community level. In some cases the action is taken immediately by the community (e.g., clearing the debris from the neighbourhood drains). The project also collaborates with NGOs such as the national Red Cross to identify actions and make plans.;;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;Experience of past disasters usually comes up in the project's co-design workshops and organically feeds into design of interventions and actions.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions.;The project hosts co-design multi-stakeholder workshops where the baseline data analysis findings are shared with the stakeholders, and collaboratively validated. These findings are then used in designing interventions or changes to the weather information system.;;0- We do not develop actions that contribute to this subcategory;We do not develop actions that contribute to this subcategory.;We do not plan to do this directly, but as we have done in the past, on ad-hoc basis we will connect the beneficiaries with organisations/donors/etc if we come across a relevant opportunity.;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;As DARAJA’s target beneficiaries are communities living in informal settlements, the project works closely with the communities by leveraging the community social structures. The interventions are co-designed with the communities and the implementation is also collaborative. This process may include training of community leaders or volunteers, e.g., training on interpreting meteorological information and repackaging it for the local community. In Nairobi, in the site of the first DARAJA project, a group of community members who worked with the project organised themselves into a community based organisation called Weather Mtaani with the support of the project after the completion of DARAJA. The group is able to continue the services piloted during the project, make decisions and coordinate with other stakeholders such as the city authority and the NHMS  after the project.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;DARAJA's core pillar is coproduction. Most design decisions for DARAJA are made with stakeholders, especially the community who are the primary beneficiaries. DARAJA supports the community decision-making process by creating an enabling environment where data, participatory approaches, stakeholder interaction, etc are used to make informed decisions. The resulting decisions are user-centric and fits the needs of the community well.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions.;DARAJA brings together national forecasters and informal settlement communities (who generally feel excluded from public services) to improve forecasts and early warnings. At the start of the project there is low trust in the NHMS and the forecasts. However, through continuous engagement communities' trust in the NHMS increases along with a greater sense of ownership of the forecast process that they have codeveloped.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;One of the primary outcomes of DARAJA is communities' have improved access to weather information. The Information Ecosystem Mapping tool helps the project understand the way information flows through the city system, what the barriers are, and which channels/actors can be strengthened. Using these findings changes are made in the weather information dissemination process to include the channels that communities prefer and have greater access to. Channels that provide feedback loops are incorporated which enables two-way communication between the groups.;;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;The DARAJA programme aims to create a network of stakeholders who involved in the implementation of DARAJA projects in different geographies. We have a DARAJA web platform in the works to enable this network to communicate with each other with DARAJA at its core, e.g., sharing knowledge from their experience of implementing DARAJA, providing technical advice, making partnerships, etc. In a recent proposal focused on MENA, an output is a network of cities in the region who will be observers in the pilot demonstrator and will be involved in some knowledge exchange activities.;;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;Using the information ecosystem mapping tool, DARAJA identifies actors who are not currently in the weather information system but could be beneficial if included (e.g., schools). This creates a more dynamic and robust information ecosystem, one that meets a diverse community's needs and thereby results in a more resilient communication system.;;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;The communication system codesigned through DARAJA that carries weather information such as forecasts and early warnings is dynamic and includes multiple channels. The choice of channels and actors is based on data on the communication context and preferences of the community. A community member will receive forecasts through multiple channels. Thus, even if one channel fails, the information will still be carried via other channels.;;0- We do not develop actions that contribute to this subcategory;This is outside the scope of DARAJA which is primarily focused on weather information.

Specifically, the centrality of farmers in the transition toward more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable   food systems was affirmed both during COP to UNFCCC and UN FSS. On May 1st 2021, the second wave of   the UNFSS - a collection of proposals submitted for the 5 Action Tracks (Nutrition, Sustainable Consumption, Nature Positive Production, Livelihood and Equality and   Resilience, which are the pillars guiding the transition) – closed. Within the proposals, farmers were recognized as the drivers and promoters of concrete solutions:   the WFO submitted 75 game-changing solutions, including practices coming from the Climakers initiative. These solutions were accepted and included in the second initial set of ideas presented to the UN FSS Secretariat. This represents a tremendous achievement as it officially recognizes the strength of a multi-stakeholder partnership in boosting farmer driven solutions to be scaled up to build more climate resilient sustainable food systems.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;Women and girls;;Elderly;Children & Youth;Indigenous and traditional communities;;;;Low income communities;Farmers;VMC are partners/co-leads in the project/action;;;;;;;Involvement and impact are intentional;;In Glasgow, within the framework of the COP 26 Farmers’ Day, on November 3,  an official side event “THE CLIMAKERS: Presenting the Toolkit for a Farmer – Driven Implementation of NDCs” has been hosted. Indeed, the event provided an excellent venue to officially launch the “Guidelines for Policy Makers“, designed by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security, CCAFS, based on the farmers’ best practices collected within The Climakers  initiative. These guidelines want to provide governments and policymakers with farmerdriven, science-based, and result-oriented solutions to implement the Paris Agreement at the national level successfully.

Further, the Centre of Excellence on Gender-smart Solutions advocates to apply a gender-lens in CDRFI solutions, as women face different threats after a disaster than men. Overall, this increases the resilience of poor people as well as women in the context of climate risk.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;CDRFI solutions such as Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options or developing risk management strategies are only a few approaches that could be named here that help building (financial) resilience in the form of access to financial resources before or just after a disaster happens. Targeted communities are, as for the entire Partnership, mainly poor and vulnerable people and countries.;;3- This subcategory is in the core of an important part of our actions;A number of projects under the IGP improve planning through the development of national Disaster Risk Finance (DRF) strategies, embedding of implemented solutions in contingency planning and the provision of risk modeling and analytics. This helps governments to plan ahead of a disaster/climate risk and specifically determines how to act in the case a disaster happens. This entire process thus reduces the exposed risk to climate change for local communities and decreases the overall vulnerability to climate change. Furthermore, the financial strengthening of Early warning systems is one element of some IGP projects which also helps to plan ahead of a disaster.;;0- We do not develop actions that contribute to this subcategory;There are no current plans to implement such action.;There are no current plans to implement such action.;2- A few of our actions contribute to this subcategory;IGP and members provide workshops to The Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group of Ministers of Finance of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and national governments on the availability of CDRFI solutions.

This is done by the different working groups the IGP offers, where members can conect and interact and learn from each other. Also, the IGP offers a match-making, where there IGP connects the members where needed (e.g. research or other requests). By this, the CDRFI community is in a constant exchange via the Partnership.;;1- We contribute to this subcategory but indirectly, It’s not in the core of our activities;The existence of insurance and risk finance  contribute to the diversity of risk management strategies. An efficient and comprehensive Disaster Risk Finance/Management strategy needs to apply a so called risk layering approach meaning that different CDRFI solutions fit the different frequencies and intensities of the disasters. The application of different CDRFI solutions therefore adds the needed diversity to these strategies.;;0- We do not develop actions that contribute to this subcategory;There are no current plans to implement such action.;;4- This subcategory is in the core of the most of our actions;IGP promotes and implements insurance and risk finance solutions in all related projects.
